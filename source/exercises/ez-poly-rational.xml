  <exercise xml:id="ez-poly-rational-applications-box">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A rectangular box is being constructed so that its base is <m>1.5</m> times as long as it is wide.  In addition, suppose that material for the base and top of the box costs $<m>3.75</m> per square foot, while material for the sides costs $<m>2.50</m> per square foot.  Finally, we want the box to hold <m>8</m> cubic feet of volume.

        <ol marker="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Draw a labeled picture of the box with <m>x</m> as the length of the shorter side of the box's base and <m>h</m> as its height.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Determine a formula involving <m>x</m> and <m>h</m> for the total surface area, <m>S</m>, of the box.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use your work from (b) along with the given information about cost to determine a formula for the total cost, <m>C</m>, oif the box in terms of <m>x</m> and <m>h</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use the volume constraint given in the problem to write an equation that relates <m>x</m> and <m>h</m>, and solve that equation for <m>h</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Combine your work in (c) and (d) to write the cost, <m>C</m>, of the box as a function solely of <m>x</m>.

              What is the domain of the cost function?  How does a graph of the cost function appear?  What does this suggest about the ideal box for the given constraints?

    <statement>
      <p>
        A cylindrical can is being constructed so that its volume is <m>16</m> cubic inches.  Suppose that material for the lids (the top and bottom) cost $<m>0.11</m> per square inch and material for the <q>side</q> of the can costs $<m>0.07</m> per square inch.  Determine a formula for the total cost of the can as a function of the can's radius.  What is the domain of the function and why?
