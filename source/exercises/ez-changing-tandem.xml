  <exercise xml:id="ez-tandem-spherical-tank-conical-chimney">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose we have an unusual tank whose base is a perfect sphere with radius <m>3</m> feet, and then atop the spherical base is a cylindrical <q>chimney</q> that is a circular cylinder of radius <m>1</m> foot and height <m>2</m> feet, as shown in <xref ref="F-ez-chiminea">Figure</xref>.  The tank is initially empty, but then a spigot is turned on that pumps water into the tank at a constant rate of <m>1.25</m> cubic feet per minute.

        Let <m>V</m> denote the total volume of water (in cubic feet) in the tank at any time <m>t</m> (in minutes), and <m>h</m> the depth of the water (in feet) at time <m>t</m>.

              It is possible to use calculus to show that the total volume this tank can hold is <m>V_{\text{full}} = \pi(22 + \frac{38}{3}\sqrt{2}) \approx 119.12</m> cubic feet.  In addition, the actual height of the tank (from the bottom of the spherical base to the top of the chimney) is <m>h_{\text{full}} = \sqrt{8} + 5 \approx 7.83</m> feet.  How long does it take the tank to fill?   Why?

  <exercise xml:id="ez-tandem-spherical-tank-height-constant-rate">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose we have a tank that is a perfect sphere with radius <m>6</m> feet.  The tank is initially empty, but then a spigot is turned on that is pumping water into the tank in a very special way:  the faucet is regulated so that the depth of water in the tank is increasing at a constant rate of <m>0.4</m> feet per minute.

  <exercise xml:id="ez-tandem-car-position-time">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The relationship between the position, <m>s</m>, of a car driving on a straight road at time <m>t</m> is given by the graph
        pictured at left in <xref ref="F-tandem-car-pos">Figure</xref>.
        The car's position<fn>You can think of the car's position like mile-markers on a highway.  Saying that <m>s = 500</m> means that the car is located <m>500</m> feet from <q>marker zero</q> on the road.</fn> has units measured in thousands of feet while time is measured in minutes.
        For instance, the point <m>(4,6)</m> on the graph indicates that after <m>4</m> minutes,
        the car has traveled <m>6000</m> feet from its starting location.

          <li>
            <p>
              Write several sentences that explain the how the car is being driven and how you make these conclusions from the graph.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              How far did the car travel between <m>t = 2</m> and <m>t = 10</m>?

          <li>
            <p>
              Does the car ever travel in reverse?  Why or why not?  If not, how would the graph have to look to indicate such motion?

            <p>
              On the blank axes in <xref ref="F-tandem-car-pos">Figure</xref>, plot points or sketch a curve to describe the behavior of a car that is driven in the following way:  from <m>t = 0</m> to <m>t = 5</m> the car travels straight down the road at a constant rate of <m>1000</m> feet per minute.  At <m>t = 5</m>, the car pulls over and parks for <m>2</m> full minutes.  Then, at <m>t = 7</m>, the car does an abrupt U-turn and returns in the opposite direction at a constant rate of <m>800</m> feet per minute for <m>5</m> additional minutes.  As part of your work, determine (and label) the car's location at several additional points in time other than <m>t = 0, 5, 7, 12</m>.
