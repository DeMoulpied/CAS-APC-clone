  <exercise xml:id="ez-finding-angles-plane">
    <statement>
      <p>
        At an airshow, a pilot is flying low over a runway while maintaining a constant altitude of <m>2000</m> feet and a constant speed.  On a straight path over the runway, the pilot observes on her laser range-finder that the distance from the plane to a fixed building adjacent to the runway is <m>7500</m> feet.  Five seconds later, she observes that distance to the same building is now <m>6000</m> feet.
