  <exercise xml:id="ez-trig-tangent-ramp">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A wheelchair ramp is to be built so that the angle it forms with level ground is <m>4^{\circ}</m>.
        If the ramp is going to rise from a level sidewalk up to a front porch that is <m>3</m> feet above the ground,
        how long does the ramp have to be?
        How far from the front porch will it meet the sidewalk?
        What is the slope of the ramp?

  <exercise xml:id="ez-trig-tangent-kite">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A person is flying a kite and at the end of a fixed length of string.  Assume there is no slack in the string.
      </p>

      <p>
        At a certain moment, the kite is <m>170</m> feet off the ground, and the angle of elevation the string makes with the ground is <m>40^\circ</m>.

          <li>
            <p>

  <exercise xml:id="ez-trig-tangent-plane">
    <statement>
      <p>
        An airplane is flying at a constant speed along a straight path above a straight road at a constant elevation of <m>2400</m> feet.  A person on the road observes the plane flying directly at them and uses a sextant to measure the angle of elevation from them to the plane.  The first measurement they take records an angle of <m>36^\circ</m>; a second measurement taken <m>2</m> seconds later is <m>41^\circ</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        How far did the plane travel during the two seconds between the two angle measurements?  How fast was the plane flying?
