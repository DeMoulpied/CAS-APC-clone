			In <xref ref="act-trig-right-sine-cosine-ratio">Activity</xref>, we determined the distance between two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> on opposite sides of a river by knowing a length along one shore of the river and the angle formed between a point downstream and the point on the opposite shore, as pictured in <xref ref="F-right-act-river-rev">Figure</xref>. By first using the cosine of the angle, we determined the value of <m>z</m> and from there were able to use the sine of the angle to find <m>w</m>, the river's width, which turns out to be 
			<me>
				w = 50 \cdot \frac{\sin(56.4)}{\cos(56.4)}
			</me>.

	<p>
		It turns out that we regularly need to evaluate the ratio of the sine and cosine functions at the same angle, so it is convenient to define a new function to be their ratio.

  	</sidebyside>

  	<p>
  		Because the tangent function is defined in terms of the two fundamental circular functions by the rule <m>\tan(t) = \frac{\sin(t)}{\cos(t)}</m>, we can use our understanding of the sine and cosine functions to make sense of the tangent function.  In particular, we can think of the tangent of an angle from two different perspectives: as an angle in standard position in the unit circle, or as an angle in a right triangle.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  		From the viewpoint of <xref ref="F-tan-defn-unit-circle">Figure</xref>, as the point corresponding to angle <m>t</m> traverses the circle and generates the point <m>(a,b)</m>, we know <m>\cos(t) = a</m> and <m>\sin(t) = b</m>, and therefore the tangent function tracks the ratio of these two quantities, and is given by
  		<me>
  			\tan(t) = \frac{\sin(t)}{\cos(t)} = \frac{b}{a}
  		</me>.
  		From the perspective of any right triangle (not necessarily in the unit circle) with hypotenuse <q>hyp</q> and legs
  		<q>adj</q> and <q>opp</q> that are respectively adjacent and opposite the known angle <m>\theta</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-tan-right-triangle-TOA">Figure</xref>, we know that <m>\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}}</m> and <m>\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adj}}{\text{hyp}}</m>.  Substituting these expressions for <m>\sin(\theta)</m> and <m>\cos(\theta)</m> in the rule for the tangent function, we see that
  		<me>
  			\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{\frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}}}{\frac{\text{adj}}{\text{hyp}}} = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}}
  		</me>.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  		We typically use the first perspective of tracking the ratio of the <m>y</m>-coordinate to the <m>x</m>-coordinate of a point traversing the unit circle in order to think of the overall behavior and graph of the tangent function, and use the second perspective in a right triangle whenever we are working to determine missing values in a triangle.
  	</p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-trig-tangent-properties">
  	<title>Properties of the tangent function</title>

	  <p>
	  	Because the tangent function is defined in terms of the sine and cosine functions, its values and behavior are completely determined by those two functions.  To begin, we know the value of <m>\tan(t)</m> for every special angle <m>t</m> on the unit circle that we identified for the sine and cosine functions.  For instance, we know that
	  	<me>
	  		\tan \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) = \frac{ \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) }{ \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) } = \frac{ \frac{1}{2} }{ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} } = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
	  	</me>.
	  	Executing similar computations for every familiar special angle on the unit circle, we find the results shown in <xref ref="T-tangent-values">Table</xref> and <xref ref="T-tangent-values-2">Table</xref>.  We also note that anywhere <m>\cos(t) = 0</m>, the value of <m>\tan(t)</m> is undefined.  We record such instances in the table by writing <q>u</q>.

		<p>
			<xref ref="T-tangent-values">Table</xref> and <xref ref="T-tangent-values-2">Table</xref> helps us identify trends in the tangent function.  For instance, we observe that the sign of <m>\tan(t)</m> is positive in Quadrant I, negative in Quadrant II, positive in Quadrant III, and negative in Quadrant IV.  This holds because the sine and cosine functions have the same sign in the first and third quadrants, and opposite signs in the other two quadrants.  
		</p>

		<p>
			In addition, we observe that as <m>t</m>-values in the first quadrant get closer to <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, <m>\sin(t)</m> gets closer to <m>1</m>, while <m>\cos(t)</m> gets closer to <m>0</m> (while being always positive).  Noting that <m>\frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.57</m>, we observe that
			<me>
				\tan(1.47) = \frac{\sin(1.47)}{\cos(1.47)} \approx \frac{0.995}{0.101} = 9.887
			</me>
			and
			<me>
				\tan(1.56) = \frac{\sin(1.56)}{\cos(1.56)} \approx \frac{0.9994}{0.0108} = 92.6205
			</me>.
			Because the ratio of numbers closer and closer to <m>1</m> divided by numbers closer and closer to <m>0</m> (but positive) increases without bound, this means that <m>\tan(t)</m> increases without bound as <m>t</m> approaches <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> from the left side.  Once <m>t</m> is slightly greater than <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> in Quadrant II, the value of <m>\sin(t)</m> stays close to <m>1</m>, but now the value of <m>\cos(t)</m> is negative (and close to zero).  For instance, <m>\cos(1.58) \approx -0.0092</m>.  This makes the value of <m>\tan(t)</m> decrease without bound (negative and getting further away from <m>0</m>) for <m>t</m> approaching <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> from the right side, and results in <m>h(t) = \tan(t)</m> having a vertical asymptote at <m>t = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.  The periodicity and sign behaviors of <m>\sin(t)</m> and <m>\cos(t)</m> mean this asymptotic behavior of the tangent function will repeat.

			Plotting the data in the table along with the expected asymptotes and connecting the points intuitively, we see the graph of the tangent function in <xref ref="F-tangent-plot">Figure</xref>.

		<p>
			We see from <xref ref="T-tangent-values">Table</xref> and <xref ref="T-tangent-values-2">Table</xref> as well as from <xref ref="F-tangent-plot">Figure</xref> that the tangent function has period <m>P = \pi</m> and that the function is increasing on any interval on which it is defined.  We summarize our recent work as follows.

			While the tangent function is an interesting mathematical function for its own sake, its most important applications arise in the setting of right triangles, and for the remainder of this section we will focus on that perspective.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-trig-tangent-applications">
  	<title>Using the tangent function in right triangles</title>
  	<p>
  		The tangent function offers us an additional choice when working in right triangles with limited information.  In the setting where we have a right triangle with one additional known angle, if we know the length of the hypotenuse, we can use either the sine or cosine of the angle to help us easily find the remaining side lengths.  But in the setting where we know only the length of one leg, the tangent function now allows us to determine the value of the remaining leg in a similarly straightforward way, and from there the hypotenuse.
  	</p>

  	<example>
  		<statement>
				<p>
  					Use the tangent function to determine the width, <m>w</m>, of the river in <xref ref="F-right-act-river-rev-2">Figure</xref>.  (Note that here we are revisiting the problem in <xref ref="act-trig-right-sine-cosine-ratio">Activity</xref>, which we previously solved without using the tangent function.)  What other information can we now easily determine?
 	 			</p>

  				<figure xml:id="F-right-act-river-rev-2">
					<caption>A right triangle with one angle and one leg known.</caption>
					<image width="40%" source="images/right-act-river-riv" />
				</figure>
  		</statement>
  		<solution>
  			<p>
  				Using the perspective that <m>\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}}</m> in a right triangle, in this context we have 
  				<me>
  					\tan(56.4^\circ) = \frac{w}{50} 
  				</me>
  				and thus <m>w = 50\tan(56.4)</m> is the exact width of the river.  Using a computational device, we find that <m>w \approx 75.256</m>.
  			</p>
  		  	<p>
  				Once we know the river's width, we can use the Pythagorean theorem or the sine function to determine the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>A</m>, at which point all <m>6</m> parts of the triangle are known.
 		 	</p>	
  		</solution>
  	</example>

  	<p>
  		The tangent function finds a wide range of applications in finding missing information in right triangles where information about one or more legs of the triangle is known.

In addition, while the period of the sine and cosine functions is <m>P = 2\pi</m>, the period of the tangent function is <m>P = \pi</m> due to how the sine and cosine functions repeat the same values (with different signs) as a point traverses the unit circle.
