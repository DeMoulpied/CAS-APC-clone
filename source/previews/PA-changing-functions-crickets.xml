			Use <xref ref="eq-functions-Dolbear">Equation</xref> to respond to the questions below.

			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						If we hear snowy tree crickets chirping at a rate of <m>92</m> chirps per minute, what does Dolbear's model suggest should be the outside temperature?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If the outside temperature is <m>77^\circ</m> F, how many chirps per minute should we expect to hear?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Is the model valid for determining the number of chirps one should hear when the outside temperature is <m>35^\circ</m> F?  Why or why not?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Suppose that in the morning an observer hears <m>65</m> chirps per minute, and several hours later hears <m>75</m> chirps per minute.  How much has the temperature risen between observations?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Dolbear's Law is known to be accurate for temperatures from <m>50^\circ</m> to <m>85^\circ</m>.  What is the fewest number of chirps per minute an observer could expect to hear?  the greatest number of chirps per minute?
