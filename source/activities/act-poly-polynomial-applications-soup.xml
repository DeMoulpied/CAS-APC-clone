	<statement>
		<p>
			Suppose that we want to construct a cylindrical can using <m>60</m> square inches of material for the surface of the can.  In this context, how does the can's volume depend on the radius we choose?
		</p>

		<p>
			Let the cylindrical can have base radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Use the formula for the surface area of a cylinder and the given constraint that the can's surface area is <m>60</m> square inches to write an equation that connects the radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Solve the equation you found in (a) for <m>h</m> in terms of <m>r</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Recall that the volume of a cylinder is <m>V = \pi r^2 h</m>.  Use your work in (b) to write <m>V</m> as a function of the single variable <m>r</m>; simplify the formula as much as possible.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						What is the domain of the function <m>V</m> in the context of the physical setting of this problem?  (Hint: how does the constraint on surface area provide a largest possible value for <m>r</m>?  Think about the maximum area that can be allocated to the top and bottom of the can.)
