			Point your browser to the <em>Desmos</em> worksheet at <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0zu">http://gvsu.edu/s/0zu</url>.
			In what follows, we explore the behavior of power functions of the form <m>y = x^n</m> where <m>n \ge 1</m>.

		            Press the <q>play</q> button next to the slider labeled <q><m>n</m>.</q>
		            Watch at least two loops of the animation and then discuss the trends that you observe.
		            Write a careful sentence each for at least two different trends.

		            Click the icons next to each of the following 8 functions so that you can see all of <m>y = x</m>,
		            <m>y = x^2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
		            <m>y = x^8</m> graphed at once.
		            On the interval <m>0 \lt x \lt 1</m>,
		            how do the graphs of <m>x^a</m> and <m>x^b</m> compare if <m>a \lt b</m>?

		        <li>
		          <p>
		            Uncheck the icons on each of the 8 functions to hide their graphs.
		            Click the settings icon to change the domain settings for the axes,
		            and change them to <m>-10 \le x \le 10</m> and <m>-10,000 \le y \le 10,000</m>.
		            Play the animation through twice and then discuss the trends that you observe.
		            Write a careful sentence each for at least two different trends.
