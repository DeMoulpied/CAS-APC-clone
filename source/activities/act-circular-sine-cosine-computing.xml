			Answer the following questions exactly wherever possible.  If you estimate a value, do so to at least <m>5</m> decimal places of accuracy.

						The <m>x</m> coordinate of the point on the unit circle that lies in the third quadrant and whose <m>y</m>-coordinate is <m>y = -\frac{3}{4}</m>.

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The <m>y</m>-coordinate of the point on the unit circle generated by a central angle opening counterclockwise with one side on the positive <m>x</m>-axis that measures <m>t = 2</m> radians.

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The <m>x</m>-coordinate of the point on the unit circle generated by a central angle with one side on the positive <m>x</m>-axis that measures <m>t = -3.05</m> radians.  (With the negative radian measure, we view the angle as opening counterclockwise from its initial side on the positive <m>x</m>-axis.)
