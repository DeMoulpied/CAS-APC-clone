	<statement>
		<p>
	      The summit of Africa's largest peak, Mt.
	      Kilimanjaro<fn>
	      The main context of this problem comes from Exercise 30 on p.<nbsp />27 of Connally's
	      <em>Functions Modeling Change</em>, 5th ed.
	      </fn>, has two main ice fields and a glacier at its peak.
	      Geologists measured the ice cover in the year 2000 (<m>t = 0</m>) to be approximately <m>1951</m> m<m>^2</m>;
	      in the year 2007, the ice cover measured <m>1555</m> m<m>^2</m>.
	  	</p>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Suppose that the amount of ice cover at the peak of Mt.
	            Kilimanjaro is changing at a constant average rate from year to year.
	            Find a linear model <m>A = f(t)</m> whose output is the area of the ice cover,
	            <m>A</m>,
	            in square meters in year <m>t</m>
	            (where <m>t</m> is the number of years after 2000).
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            What do the slope and <m>A</m>-intercept mean in the model you found in (a)?  In particular, what are the units on the slope?
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Compute <m>f(17)</m>.
	            What does this quantity measure?
	            Write a complete sentence to explain.
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            If the model holds further into the future,
	            when do we predict the ice cover will vanish?
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            In light of your work above,
	            what is a reasonable domain to use for the model <m>A = f(t)</m>?
	            What is the corresponding range?
	          </p>
