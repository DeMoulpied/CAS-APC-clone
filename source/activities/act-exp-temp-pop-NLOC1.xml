	<statement>
		<p>
			A can of soda is initially at room temperature, <m>72.3^\circ</m> Fahrenheit, and at time <m>t = 0</m> is placed in a refrigerator set at <m>37.7^\circ</m>.  In addition, we know that after <m>30</m> minutes, the soda's temperature has dropped to <m>59.5^\circ</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol marker="a.">
		        <li>
		          <p>
		            Use algebraic reasoning and your understanding of the physical situation to determine the exact values of <m>a</m>,
		            <m>c</m>,
		            and <m>k</m> in the model <m>F(t) = ae^{-kt}+c</m>.
		            Write at least one careful sentence to explain your thinking.

		        <li>
		          <p>
		            Determine the exact time the object's temperature is <m>42.4^\circ</m>.
		            Clearly show your algebraic work and thinking.

		          <p>
		            Find the average rate of change of <m>F</m> on the interval <m>[25,30]</m>.
		            What is the meaning
		            (with units)
		            of this value?

		        <li>
		          <p>
		            If everything stayed the same except the value of <m>F(0)</m>,
		            and instead <m>F(0) = 65</m>,
		            would the value of <m>k</m> be larger or smaller?
		            Why?
