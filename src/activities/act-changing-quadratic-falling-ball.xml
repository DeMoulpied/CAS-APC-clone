	  <statement>
	    <p>
	      A water balloon is tossed vertically from a window at an initial height of 37 feet and with an initial velocity of 41 feet per second.
		</p>

		<p>
	      <ol label="a.">
	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Determine a formula, <m>s(t)</m>,
	            for the function that models the height of the water balloon at time <m>t</m>.
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Plot the function in <em>Desmos</em>
	            in an appropriate window.
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Use the graph to estimate the time the water balloon lands.
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Use algebra to find the exact
	            time the water balloon lands.
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Determine the exact time the water balloon reaches its highest point and its height at that time.
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Compute the average rate of change of <m>s</m> on the intervals <m>[1.5, 2]</m>,
	            <m>[2, 2.5]</m>, <m>[2.5,3]</m>.
	            Include units on your answers and write one sentence to explain the meaning of the values you found.
	            What lines on the graph of <m>s</m> have the same slope as these average rates of change?
