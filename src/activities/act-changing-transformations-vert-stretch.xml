Be sure to label several points on each of <m>r</m>, <m>g</m>, and <m>h</m> with arrows to indicate their correspondence.

						On the additional copies of the two figures below, sketch the graphs of the following transformed functions:  <m>y = m(x) = 2r(x+1)-1</m> (at left) and <m>y = n(x) = \frac{1}{2}s(x-2)+2</m>.  As above, be sure to label several points on each graph and indicate their correspondence to points on the original parent function.

						Describe in words how the function <m>y = m(x) = 2r(x+1)-1</m> is the result of three elementary transformations of <m>y = r(x)</m>.  Does the order in which these transformations occur matter?  Why or why not?
