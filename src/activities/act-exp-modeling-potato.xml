	<statement>
		<p>
			A potato initially at room temperature (<m>68^\circ</m>) is placed in an oven (at <m>350^\circ</m>) at time <m>t = 0</m>.
      		It is known that the potato's temperature at time <m>t</m> is given by the function
      		<m>F(t) = a - b(0.98)^t</m> for some positive constants <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
     		where <m>F</m> is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and <m>t</m> is time in minutes.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						What is the numerical value of <m>F(0)</m>?
            			What does this tell you about the value of <m>a - b</m>?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Based on the context of the problem,
            			what should be the long-range behavior of the function <m>F(t)</m>?
            			Use this fact along with the behavior of
            			<m>(0.98)^t</m> to determine the value of <m>a</m>.  Write a sentence to explain your thinking.
					</p>
				</li>

					<p>
						What is the value of <m>b</m>?  Why?

								Check your work above by plotting the function <m>F</m> using graphing technology in an appropriate window.
								Record your results on the axes provided in <xref ref="F-modeling-act-blank-axes-potato">Figure</xref>, labeling the scale on the axes.
            					Then, use the graph to estimate the time at which the potato's temperature reaches <m>325</m> degrees.

						How can we view the function <m>F(t) = a - b(0.98)^t</m> as a transformation of the parent function <m>f(t) = (0.98)^t</m>?  Explain.
