	<statement>
		<p>
			For each of the following prompts, try to determine a formula for a polynomial that satisfies the given criteria.  If no such polynomial exists, explain why.

				<li>
					<p>
						A polynomial <m>f</m> of degree <m>10</m> whose zeros are <m>x = -12</m> (multiplicity <m>3</m>), <m>x = -9</m> (multiplicity <m>2</m>), <m>x = 4</m> (multiplicity <m>4</m>), and <m>x = 10</m> (multiplicity <m>1</m>), and <m>f</m> satisfies <m>f(0) = 21</m>.  What can you say about the values of <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x)</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)</m>.

						A polynomial <m>p</m> of degree <m>9</m> that satisfies <m>p(0) = -2</m> and <m>p</m> has the graph shown in <xref ref="F-polynomial-degree-9">Figure</xref>.  Assume that all of the zeros of <m>p</m> are shown in the figure.
					</p>

					
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A polynomial <m>q</m> of degree <m>8</m> with <m>3</m> distinct real zeros (possibly of different multiplicities) such that <m>q</m> has the sign chart in <xref ref="F-polynomial-sign-chart-2">Figure</xref> and satisfies <m>q(0) = -10</m>.
