			Let <m>s(x) = \frac{3x - 5}{7x^2 + 2x - 11}</m> and <m>u(x) = \frac{3x^2 - 5x + 1}{7x + 2}</m>.  Note that both the numerator and denominator of each of these rational functions increases without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>, and in addition that <m>x^2</m> is the highest order term present in each of <m>s</m> and <m>u</m>.

				<li>
					<p>
						Using a similar algebraic approach to our work in <xref ref="act-poly-rational-long-term-1">Activity</xref>, multiply <m>s(x)</m> by <m>1 = \frac{\frac{1}{x^2}}{\frac{1}{x^2}}</m> and hence evaluate
						<me>
							\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x - 5}{7x^2 + 2x - 11}

						What value do you find?

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Plot the function <m>y = s(x)</m> on the interval <m>[-10,10]</m>.  What is the graphical meaning of the limit you found in (a)?
