	<statement>
		<p>
			For each of the following prompts, give an example of a function that satisfies the stated characteristics by both providing a formula and sketching a graph.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						A function <m>p</m> that is always decreasing and decreases at a constant rate.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A function <m>q</m> that is always increasing and increases at an increasing rate.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A function <m>r</m> that is always increasing for <m>t \lt 2</m>, always decreasing for <m>t \gt 2</m>, and is always changing at a decreasing rate.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A function <m>s</m> that is always increasing and increases at a decreasing rate.  (Hint: to find a formula, think about how you might use a transformation of a familiar function.)
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A function <m>u</m> that is always decreasing and decreases at a decreasing rate.
