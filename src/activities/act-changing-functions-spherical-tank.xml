	<statement>
		<p>
			Consider a spherical tank of radius <m>4</m> m that is filling with water.  Let 
			<m>V</m> be the volume of water in the tank (in cubic meters) at a given time, and
			<m>h</m> the depth of the water (in meters) at the same time.  It can be shown using calculus 
			that <m>V</m> is a function of <m>h</m> according to the rule
      		<me>
        		V = f(h) = \frac{\pi}{3} h^2(12-h)
      		</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						What values of <m>h</m> make sense to consider in the context of this function?  What values of <m>V</m> make sense in the same context?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						What is the domain of the function <m>f</m> in the context of the spherical tank?  Why?  What is the corresponding codomain?  Why?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Determine and interpret (with appropriate units) the values
            			<m>f(2)</m>, <m>f(4)</m>, and <m>f(8)</m>.  What is important about the value of <m>f(8)</m>?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Consider the claim: <q>since <m>f(9) = \frac{\pi}{3} 9^2(12-9) = 81\pi \approx 254.47</m>, when the water is <m>9</m> meters deep, there is about <m>254.47</m> cubic meters of water in the tank</q>.  Is this claim valid? Why or why not?  Further, does it make sense to observe that <q><m>f(13) = -\frac{169\pi}{3}</m></q>?  Why or why not?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
			            Can you determine a value of <m>h</m> for which <m>f(h) = 300</m> cubic meters?
