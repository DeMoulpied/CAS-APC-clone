	<statement>
		<p>
			Suppose that a population of animals that lives on an island (measured in thousands) is known to grow according to the logistic model, where <m>t</m> is measured in years.  We know the following information:  <m>P(0) = 2.45</m>, <m>P(3) = 4.52</m>, and as <m>t</m> increases without bound, <m>P(t)</m> approaches <m>11.7</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Determine the exact values of <m>A</m>, <m>M</m>, and <m>k</m> in the logistic model
            			<me>
              				P(t) = \frac{A}{1 + Me^{-kt}}
            			</me>.
            			Clearly show your algebraic work and thinking.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Plot your model from (a) and check that its values match the desired characteristics.
            			Then, compute the average rate of change of <m>P</m> on the intervals <m>[0,2]</m>,
            			<m>[2,4]</m>, <m>[4,6]</m>, and <m>[6,8]</m>.
            			What is the meaning (with units) of the values you've found?  How is the population growing on these intervals?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Find the exact time value when the population will be <m>10</m> (thousand).  Show your algebraic work and thinking.
