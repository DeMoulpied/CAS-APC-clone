			According to a shipping company's regulations, the girth plus the length of a parcel they transport for their lowest rate may not exceed <m>120</m> inches, where by <em>girth</em> we mean the perimeter of the smallest end.
		</p>

		<figure xml:id="F-act-postal">
			<caption>A rectangular parcel with a square end.</caption>

		<p>
			Suppose that we want to ship a parcel that has a square end of width <m>x</m> and an overall length of <m>y</m>, both measured in inches.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Label the provided picture, using <m>x</m> for the length of each side of the square end, and <m>y</m> for the other edge of the package.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						How does the length plus girth of <m>120</m> inches result in an equation that relates <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>?  This equation is often called a <em>constraint</em> equation.  Explain, and state the equation.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Solve the equation you found in (b) for one of the variables present.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Hence determine the volume, <m>V</m>, of the package as a function of a single variable.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						What is the domain of the function <m>V</m> in the context of the physical setting of this problem?  (Hint: what's the maximum value of <m>x</m>?  the maximum value of <m>y</m>?)
