	<statement>
		<p>
			By experimenting with coefficients in <em>Desmos</em>, find a formula for a polynomial function that has the stated properties, or explain why no such polynomial exists.  (If you enter <c>p(x)=a+bx+cx^2+dx^3+fx^4+gx^5</c> in <em>Desmos</em><fn>We skip using <c>e</c> as one of the constants since <em>Desmos</em> reserves <c>e</c> as the Euler constant.</fn>, you'll get prompted to add sliders that make it easy to explore a degree <m>5</m> polynomial.)
