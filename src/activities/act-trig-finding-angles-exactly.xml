	<statement>
		<p>
			For each of the following scenarios, draw a picture of the situation and use inverse trigonometric functions appropriately to determine the missing information both exactly and approximately.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Consider a right triangle with legs of length <m>11</m> and <m>13</m>.  What are the measures
            			(in radians) of the non-right angles and what is the length of the hypotenuse?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Consider an angle <m>\alpha</m> in standard position (vertex at the origin, one side on the positive <m>x</m>-axis) for which we know <m>\cos(\alpha) = -\frac{1}{2}</m> and that <m>\alpha</m> lies in quadrant III. What is the measure of <m>\alpha</m> in radians?  In addition, what is the value of <m>\sin(\alpha)</m>?

						Consider an angle <m>\beta</m> in standard position for which we know
