	<statement>
		<p>
			Reason algebraically using appropriate properties of quadratic functions to answer the following questions.  Use <em>Desmos</em> to check your results graphically.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						How many quadratic functions have <m>x</m>-intercepts at <m>(-5,0)</m> and <m>(10,0)</m> and a <m>y</m>-intercept at <m>(0,-1)</m>?  Can you determine an exact formula for such a function?  If yes, do so.  If not, explain why.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Suppose that a quadratic function has vertex <m>(-3,-4)</m> and opens upward.  How many <m>x</m>-intercepts can you guarantee the function has?  Why?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						In addition to the information in (b), suppose you know that <m>q(-1) = -3</m>.  Can you determine an exact formula for <m>q</m>?  If yes, do so.  If not, explain why.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Does the quadratic function <m>p(x) = -3(x+1)^2 + 9</m> have <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, or <m>2</m> <m>x</m>-intercepts?  Reason algebraically to determine the exact values of any such intercepts or explain why none exist.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Does the quadratic function <m>w(x) = -2x^2 + 10x - 20</m> have <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, or <m>2</m> <m>x</m>-intercepts?  Reason algebraically to determine the exact values of any such intercepts or explain why none exist.
