	<statement>
	    <p>
	      Let <m>f</m> be a function that measures a car's fuel economy in the following way.
	      Given an input velocity <m>v</m> in miles per hour,
	      <m>f(v)</m> is the number of gallons of fuel that the car consumes per mile (i.e., <q>gallons per mile</q>).
	      We know that <m>f(60) = 0.04</m>.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <ol label="a.">
	        <li>
	          <p>
	            What is the meaning of the statement
	            <q><m>f(60) = 0.04</m></q>
	            in the context of the problem?
	            That is, what does this say about the car's fuel economy?
	            Write a complete sentence.
	          </p>

	        <li>

	            Consider the function <m>g(v) = \frac{1}{f(v)}</m>.
	            What is the value of <m>g(60)</m>?
	            What are the units on <m>g</m>?
	            What does <m>g</m> measure?

	            Consider the function <m>h(v) = v \cdot f(v)</m>.
	            What is the value of <m>h(60)</m>?
	            What are the units on <m>h</m>?
	            What does <m>h</m> measure?

	        		Do <m>f(60)</m>, <m>g(60)</m>, and <m>h(60)</m> tell us fundamentally different information, or are they all essentially saying the same thing?  Explain.

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            Suppose we also know that <m>f(70) = 0.045</m>.
	            Find the average rate of change of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[60,70]</m>.
	            What are the units on the average rate of change of <m>f</m>?
	            What does this quantity measure?
	            Write a complete sentence to explain.
