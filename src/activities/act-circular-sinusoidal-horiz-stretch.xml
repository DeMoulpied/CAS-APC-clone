Be sure to label several points on each of <m>f</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>k</m> with arrows to indicate their correspondence.

						On the additional copies of the two figures below, sketch the graphs of the following transformed functions:  <m>y = r(t) = 2f(\frac{1}{2}t)</m> (at left) and <m>y = s(t) = \frac{1}{2}g(2t)</m>.  As above, be sure to label several points on each graph and indicate their correspondence to points on the original parent function.

					<p>
						Describe in words how the function <m>y = r(t) = 2f(\frac{1}{2}t)</m> is the result of two elementary transformations of <m>y = f(t)</m>.  Does the order in which these transformations occur matter?  Why or why not?
