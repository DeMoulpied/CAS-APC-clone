	<statement>
		<p>
			The value of an automobile is depreciating.  When the car is <m>3</m> years old, its value is <dollar /><m>12500</m>; when the car is <m>7</m> years old, its value is <dollar /><m>6500</m>.  
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Suppose the car's value <m>t</m> years after its purchase is given by the function <m>V(t)</m> and that <m>V</m> is exponential with form <m>V(t) = ab^t</m>, what are the exact values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Using the exponential model determined in (a), determine the purchase value of the car and estimate when the car will be worth less than <dollar />1000.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Suppose instead that the car's value is modeled by a linear function <m>L</m> and satisfies the values stated at the outset of this activity.  Find a formula for <m>L(t)</m> and determine both the purchase value of the car and when the car will be worth <dollar />1000.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Which model do you think is more realistic?  Why?
