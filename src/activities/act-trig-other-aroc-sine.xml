	<statement>
		<p>
			In this activity, we investigate how a sum of two angles identity for the sine function helps us gain a different perspective on the average rate of change of the sine function.
		</p>

		<p>
			Recall that for any function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,a+h]</m>, its average rate of change is
			<me>
				AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Let <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>.  Use the definition of <m>AV_{[a,a+h]}</m> to write an expression for the average rate of change of the sine function on the interval <m>[a+h,a]</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Apply the sum of two angles identity for the sine function, <m>\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin(\alpha) \cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha) \sin(\beta)</m>, to the expression <m>\sin(a+h)</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Explain why your work in (a) and (b) together with some algebra shows that 
						<me>
							AV_{[a,a+h]} = \sin(a) \cdot \frac{\cos(h)-1}{h} - \cos(a) \frac{\sin(h)}{h}
						</me>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						In calculus, we move from <em>average</em> rate of change to <em>instantaneous</em> rate of change by letting <m>h</m> approach <m>0</m> in the expression for average rate of change.  Using a computational device in radian mode, investigate the behavior of 
						<me>
							\frac{\cos(h)-1}{h}
						</me>
						as <m>h</m> gets close to <m>0</m>.  What happens?  Similarly, how does <m>\frac{\sin(h)}{h}</m> behave for small values of <m>h</m>?  What does this tell us about <m>AV_{[a,a+h]}</m> as <m>h</m> approaches <m>0</m>?
