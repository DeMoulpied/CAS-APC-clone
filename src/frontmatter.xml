    <title>Our Goals</title>
    <p>
      This text is designed for college students who aspire to take calculus and who either need to take a course to prepare them for calculus or want to do some additional self-study.  Most of the core topics of the course will be familiar to students who have completed high school.  At the same time, we seek to take a perspective on every topic that emphasizes how it is important in calculus.  This text is also written in the spirit of <url href="https://activecalculus.org/single/"><em>Active Calculus</em></url> and is especially ideal for students who will eventually study calculus from that text.  The reader will find that the text requires them to engage actively with the material, to view ideas from multiple perspectives, and to develop deep conceptual undersanding of ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many courses at the high school and college level with titles such as <q>college algebra</q>, <q>precalculus</q>, and <q>trigonometry</q> serve other disciplines and courses other than calculus.  As such, these prerequisite classes frequently contain wide-ranging material that, while mathematically interesting and important, isn't necessary for calculus.  Perhaps because of these additional topics, certain ideas that are essential in calculus are under-emphasized or ignored.  In <em>Active Preparation for Calculus</em>, one of our top goals is to keep the focus narrow on the following most important ideas.  
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Functions as processes</em>.  The mathematical concept of function is sophisticated.  Understanding how a function is a special mathematical process that converts a collection of inputs to a collection of outputs is crucial for success in calculus, as calculus is the study of how functions change.
          </p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Library of basic functions</em>.  The vast majority of functions in calculus come from an algebraic combination of a collection of familiar basic functions that include power, circular, exponential, and logarithmic functions.  By developing understanding of a relatively small family of basic functions and using these along with transformations to consider larger collections of functions, we work to make the central objects of calculus more intuitive and accessible. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Average rate of change</em>.  The central idea in differential calculus is the instantaneous rate of change of a function, which measures how fast a function's output changes with respect to changes in the input at a particular location.  Because instantaneous rate of change is defined in terms of average rate of change, it's essential that students are comfortable and familiar with the idea, meaning, and applications of average rate of change.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Families of functions that model important phenomena</em>.  Mathematics is the language of science, and it's remarkable how effective mathematics is at representing observable physical phenonmena.  From quadratic functions that model how an object falls under the influence of gravity to shifted exponential functions that model how coffee cools to sinusoidal functions that model how a spring-mass system oscillates, familiar basic functions find many important applications in the world around us.  We regularly use these physical situations to help us see the importance of functions and to understand how families of functions that depend on different parameters are needed to represent these situations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>The sine and cosine are circular functions</em>.  Many students are first introduced to the sine and cosine functions through right triangles.  While this perspective is important, it is more important in calculus and other advanced courses to understand how the sine and cosine functions come from a point traversing a circle.  We take this circular function perspective early and first, and do so in order to develop deep understanding of how the familiar sine and cosine waves are generated.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Inverses of functions</em>.  When a function has an inverse function, the inverse function affords us the opportunity to view an idea from a new perspective.  Inverses also play a crucial role in solving algebraic equations and in determining unknown parameters in models.  We emphasize not only the perspective that an inverse function is a process that reverses the process of the original function, but also key basic functions that arise as inverses of other functions, especially with logarithms and inverse trigonometric functions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Exact values versus approximate ones</em>.  The ability to represent numbers exactly is a powerful tool in mathematics and one that is cruicial in mathematics.  We regularly and consistently distinguish between a number's exact value, such as <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, and its approximation, say <m>1.414</m>.  This idea is also closely tied to functions and function notation:  <m>e^{-1}</m>, <m>\cos(2)</m>, and <m>\ln(7)</m> are all symbolic representations of exact numbers that can only be approximated by a computer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Finding function formulas in applied settings</em>.  In applied settings with unknown variables, it's especially useful to be able to represent relationships among variables, since such relationships often lead to functions whose behavior we can study.  We work throughout <em>Active Preparation for Calculus</em> to ready students for problems in calculus that ask them to develop function formulas by observing relationships.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Long-term trends, unbounded behavior, and limits</em>.  By working to study functions as objects themselves, we often focus on trends and overall behavior.  In addition to introducing the ideas of a function being increasing or decreasing, or concave up or concave down, we also focus on using algebraic approaces to comprehend function behavior where the input and/or output increase without bound.  In anticipation of calculus, we use limit notation and work to understand how this shorthand summarizes key features of functions.

    <title>Features of the Text</title>
    <p>
      Instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation,
      including:
      <dl width="narrow">
        <li>
          <title>Motivating Questions</title>
          <p>
            At the start of each section,
            we list 2<ndash />3 <em>motivating questions</em>
            that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest to us.
            One goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating questions.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Preview Activities</title>
          <p>
            Each section of the text begins with a short introduction,
            followed by a <em>preview activity</em>.
            This brief reading and the preview activity are designed to foreshadow the upcoming ideas in the remainder of the section;
            both the reading and preview activity are intended to be accessible to students
            <em>in advance</em> of class,
            and indeed to be completed by students before a day on which a particular section is to be considered.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Activities</title>
          <p>
            A typical section in the text has at least three <em>activities</em>.
            These are designed to engage students in an inquiry-based style that encourages them to construct solutions to key examples on their own,
            working individually or in small groups.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Exercises</title>
          <p>
            There are dozens of college algebra and trignometry texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises.
            Rather than repeat standard and routine exercises in this text,
            we recommend the use of
            <webwork />
            with its access to the Open Problem Library and many thousands of relevant problems.
            In this text,
            each section simply includes 
            as well as 3<ndash />4 challenging exercises per section.
            Each has multiple parts,
            requires the student to connect several key ideas,
            and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Graphics</title>
          <p>
            As much as possible,
            we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually,
            and to encourage students to do the same.
            <!-- Throughout the text, we use full-color<fn>To keep cost low,
            the graphics in the print-on-demand version are in black and white.
            When the text itself refers to color in images,
            one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically.</fn> graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas,
            and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus. -->
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Interactive graphics</title>
          <p>
            Many of the ideas of how functions behave are best understood dynamically;
            java applets offer an often ideal format for investigations and demonstrations.
            <em>Desmos</em> provides a free and easy-to-use online graphing utility that we occasionally link to and often direct students to use.  Thanks to David Austin, there are also select interactive javascript figures within the text itself.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Summary of Key Ideas</title>
          <p>
            Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section;
            this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.

    <title>How to Use this Text</title>
    <p>
      Because the text is free,
      any professor or student may use the electronic version of the text for no charge.
      For reading on laptops or mobile devices,
      the best electronic version to use is the .html one at 
      <url href="https://activecalculus.org/single/">https://activecalculus.org/single/</url>,
      but you may also download a full .pdf copy of the text from 
      <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0vM">gvsu.edu/s/0vM</url>,
      where there is also a link to a print-on-demand option for purchasing a bound,
      softcover version for about <dollar />20.
      Other ancillary materials, such as <webwork /> .def files,

        <li>
          <title>Electronic Edition</title>
          <p>
            Because students and instructors alike have access to the book in electronic format,
            there are several advantages to the text over a traditional print text.
            One is that the text may be projected on a screen in the classroom
            (or even better, on a whiteboard)
            and the instructor may reference ideas in the text directly,
            add comments or notation or features to graphs,
            and indeed write right on the text itself.
            Students can do likewise,
            choosing to print only whatever portions of the text are needed for them.
            In addition,
            the electronic versions of the text includes live .html links to java applets,
            so student and instructor alike may follow those links to additional resources that lie outside the text itself.
            Finally,
            students can have access to a copy of the text anywhere they have internet access.
            The .html version is far superior to the .pdf version;
            this is especially true for viewing on a smartphone.
            It is worthwhile to download the .pdf version for local access in the event of internet issues.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Note.</em> In the .pdf version,
            there is not an obvious visual indicator of the live .html links,
            so some available information is suppressed.
            If you are using the text electronically in a setting with internet access,
            please know that it is assumed you are using the .html version.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Activities Workbook</title>
          <p>
            Each section of the text has a preview activity and typically at least three in-class activities 
            embedded in the discussion.
            As it is the expectation that students will complete all of these activities,
            it is ideal for them to have room to work on them adjacent to the problem statements themselves.
            As a separate document,
            we have compiled a workbook of activities that includes only the individual activity prompts,
            along with space provided for students to write their responses.
            This workbook is the one printing expense that students will almost certainly have to undertake,
            and is available in .pdf upon request, as well as for purchase for a nominal fee on Amazon.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Community of Users</title>
          <p>
            Because this text is free and open-source,
            we hope that as people use the text,
            they will contribute corrections,
            suggestions, and new material.
            The best way to communicate such feedback is by email to Matt Boelkins at boelkinm at gvsu dot edu.
            We also have a blog at <url href="http://opencalculus.wordpress.com">opencalculus.wordpress.com</url>,
            where we post new developments,
            other free resources, feedback,
            and other points of discussion.
