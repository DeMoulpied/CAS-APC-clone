	<statement>
		<p>
			A drug company<fn><em>Functions Modeling Change</em>, Connally et al p. 457ff.</fn> estimates that to produce a new drug,
			it will cost <dollar />5 million in startup resources, and that once they reach production, each gram of the drug will cost <dollar />2500 to make.  
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Determine a formula for a function <m>C(q)</m> models the cost of producing <m>q</m> grams of the drug.  What familiar kind of function is <m>C</m>?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The drug company needs to sell the drug at a price of more than <dollar />2500 per gram in order to at least break even.  To investigate how they might set prices, they first consider what their <em>average</em> cost per gram is.  What is the <em>total</em> cost of producing <m>1000</m> grams?  What is the <em>average</em> cost per gram to produce <m>1000</m> grams?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						What is the total cost of producing <m>10000</m> grams?  What is the average cost per gram to produce <m>10000</m> grams?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Our computations in (b) and (c) naturally lead us to define the <q>average cost per gram</q> function, <m>A(q)</m>, whose output is the average cost of producing <m>q</m> grams of the drug.  What is a formula for <m>A(q)</m>?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Explain why another formula for <m>A</m> is <m>A(q) = 2500 + \frac{5000000}{q}</m>.  
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						What can you say about the long-range behavior of <m>A</m>?  What does this behavior mean in the context of the problem?
					</p>
				</li>
