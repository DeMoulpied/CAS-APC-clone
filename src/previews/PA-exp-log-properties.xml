			In the following questions, we investigate how <m>\log_{10}(a \cdot b)</m> can be equivalently written in terms of <m>\log_{10}(a)</m> and  <m>\log_{10}(b)</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Write <m>10^x \cdot 10^y</m> as <m>10</m> raised to a single power.  That is, complete the equation
						<me>
							10^x \cdot 10^y = 10^{\Box}
						</me>
						by filling in the box with an appropriate expression involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						What is the simplest possible way to write <m>\log_{10}10^x</m>?  What about the simplest equivalent expression for <m>\log_{10}10^y</m>?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Explain why each of the following equalities hold:
						<md>
							<mrow>\log_{10}(10^x \cdot 10^y) &amp;= \log_{10}(10^{x+y})</mrow>
							<mrow>         &amp;= x+y</mrow>
							<mrow>         &amp;= \log_{10}(10^x) + \log_{10}(10^x)</mrow>
						</md>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Suppose that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive real numbers, so we can think of <m>a</m> as <m>10^x</m> for some real number <m>x</m> and <m>b</m> as <m>10^y</m> for some real number <m>y</m>.  That is, say that <m>a = 10^x</m> and <m>b = 10^y</m>.  What does our work in (c) tell us about <m>\log_{10}(ab)</m>?
