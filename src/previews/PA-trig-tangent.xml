	          <p>
	            Why is <m>\tan \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right)</m> not defined?
	            What are three other input values <m>x</m> for which <m>\tan(x)</m> is not defined?
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>

	            Point your browser to
	            <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0yO">http://gvsu.edu/s/0yO</url>
	            (<q>zero-y-Oh</q>) to find a <em>Desmos</em>
	            worksheet with data from the tangent function already input.  

	            Click on several of the orange points to compare your exact values in (a) with the decimal values given by <em>Desmos</em>.  

	            Add one value to the table:
	            <m>x = \frac{11\pi}{24}</m>, <m>y = T(\frac{11\pi}{24})</m>.
	            At about what coordinates does this point lie?
	            What are the respective values of
	            <m>\sin(\frac{11\pi}{24})</m> and <m>\cos(\frac{11\pi}{24})</m>?
	            Why is the value of <m>\tan(\frac{11\pi}{24})</m> so large?
	          </p>
	        </li>

	        <li>
	          <p>
	            At the top of the input lists on the left side of the
	            <em>Desmos</em> worksheet,
	            click the circle to highlight the function
	            <m>T(x) = \tan(x)</m> and thus show its plot along with the data points in orange.
	            Use the plot and your work above to answer the following important questions about the tangent function:

	            <ul>
	              <li>
	                <p>
	                  What is the domain of <m>y = \tan(x)</m>?
	                </p>
	              </li>

	              <li>
	                <p>
	                  What is the period of <m>y = \tan(x)</m>?
	                </p>
	              </li>

	              <li>
	                <p>
	                  What is the range of <m>y = \tan(x)</m>?
	                </p>
	              </li>

	                  <em>Note well:</em> At each value of <m>x</m> for which <m>\tan(x)</m> is undefined,
	                  the function <m>y = \tan(x)</m> has a vertical asymptote because the tangent function increases without bound on one side of the line and decreases without bound on the other.
	                  How might you describe the collection of all <m>x</m>-values at which
	                  <m>y = \tan(x)</m> has a vertical asymptote?
