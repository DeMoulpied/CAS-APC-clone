			In each of the following situations, determine the exact value of the unknown quantity that is identified.
		</p>

			<ol label="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						The temperature of a warming object in an oven is given by <m>F(t) = 275 - 203e^{-kt}</m>, and we know that the object's  temperature after <m>20</m> minutes is <m>F(20) = 101</m>.  Determine the exact value of <m>k</m>.
					</p>
				</li>				
				<li>
					<p>
						The temperature of a cooling object in a refrigerator is modeled by <m>F(t) = a + 37.4e^{-0.05t}</m>, and the temperature of the refrigerator is <m>39.8^\circ</m>.  By thinking about the long-term behavior of <m>e^{-0.05t}</m> and the long-term behavior of the object's temperature, determine the exact value of <m>a</m>.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						Later in this section, we'll learn that one model for how a population grows over time can be given by a function of the form 
						<me>
							P(t) = \frac{A}{1 + Me^{-kt}}
						</me>.  Models of this form lead naturally to equations that have structure like
						<men xml:id="eq-temp-pop-logistic-structure">
							3 = \frac{10}{1+x}.
						</men>
						Solve <xref ref="eq-temp-pop-logistic-structure">Equation</xref> for the exact value of <m>x</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Suppose that <m>y = a + be^{-kt}</m>.  Solve for <m>t</m> in terms of <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>k</m>, and <m>y</m>.  What does this new equation represent?
