			Open a new <em>Desmos</em> worksheet and define the following functions: <m>f(t) = 2^t</m>, <m>g(t) = 3^t</m>, <m>h(t) = (\frac{1}{3})^t</m>, and <m>p(t) = f(kt)</m>.  After you define <m>p</m>, accept the slider for <m>k</m>, and set the range of the slider to be <m>-2 \le k \le 2</m>.

						By experimenting with the value of <m>k</m>, find a value of <m>k</m> so that the graph of <m>p(t) = f(kt) = 2^{kt}</m> appears to align with the graph of <m>g(t) = 3^t</m>.   What is the value of <m>k</m>?

						Similarly, experiment to find a value of <m>k</m> so that the graph of <m>p(t) = f(kt) = 2^{kt}</m> appears to align with the graph of <m>h(t) = (\frac{1}{3})^t</m>.   What is the value of <m>k</m>?

						Given any exponential function of the form <m>b^t</m>, do you think it's possible to find a value of <m>k</m> to that <m>p(t) = f(kt) = 2^{kt}</m> is the same function as <m>b^t</m>?  Why or why not?
