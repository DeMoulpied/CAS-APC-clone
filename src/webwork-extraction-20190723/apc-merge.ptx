        <title>Our Goals</title>
        <p>
      This text is designed for college students who aspire to take calculus and who either need to take a course to prepare them for calculus or want to do some additional self-study.  Many of the core topics of the course will be familiar to students who have completed high school.  At the same time, we take a perspective on every topic that emphasizes how it is important in calculus.  This text is  written in the spirit of <url href="https://activecalculus.org/single/"><em>Active Calculus</em></url> and is especially ideal for students who will eventually study calculus from that text.  The reader will find that the text requires them to engage actively with the material, to view topics from multiple perspectives, and to develop deep conceptual undersanding of ideas.
    </p>
        <p>
      Many courses at the high school and college level with titles such as <q>college algebra</q>, <q>precalculus</q>, and <q>trigonometry</q> serve other disciplines and courses other than calculus.  As such, these prerequisite classes frequently contain wide-ranging material that, while mathematically interesting and important, isn't necessary for calculus.  Perhaps because of these additional topics, certain ideas that are essential in calculus are under-emphasized or ignored.  In <pubtitle>Active Prelude to Calculus</pubtitle>, one of our top goals is to keep the focus narrow on the following most important ideas.  
    </p>
        <p>
      <ul><li>
          <p>
            <em>Functions as processes</em>.  The mathematical concept of function is sophisticated.  Understanding how a function is a special mathematical process that converts a collection of inputs to a collection of outputs is crucial for success in calculus, as calculus is the study of how functions change.
          </p> 
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>Average rate of change</em>.  The central idea in differential calculus is the instantaneous rate of change of a function, which measures how fast a function's output changes with respect to changes in the input at a particular location.  Because instantaneous rate of change is defined in terms of average rate of change, it's essential that students are comfortable and familiar with the idea, meaning, and applications of average rate of change.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>Library of basic functions</em>.  The vast majority of functions in calculus come from an algebraic combination of a collection of familiar basic functions that include power, circular, exponential, and logarithmic functions.  By developing understanding of a relatively small family of basic functions and using these along with transformations to consider larger collections of functions, we work to make the central objects of calculus more intuitive and accessible. 
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>Families of functions that model important phenomena</em>.  Mathematics is the language of science, and it's remarkable how effective mathematics is at representing observable physical phenomena.  From quadratic functions that model how an object falls under the influence of gravity, to shifted exponential functions that model how coffee cools, to sinusoidal functions that model how a spring-mass system oscillates, familiar basic functions find many important applications in the world around us.  We regularly use these physical situations to help us see the importance of functions and to understand how families of functions that depend on different parameters are needed to represent these situations.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>The sine and cosine are circular functions</em>.  Many students are first introduced to the sine and cosine functions through right triangles.  While this perspective is important, it is more important in calculus and other advanced courses to understand how the sine and cosine functions arise from a point traversing a circle.  We take this circular function perspective early and first, and do so in order to develop deep understanding of how the familiar sine and cosine waves are generated.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>Inverses of functions</em>.  When a function has an inverse function, the inverse function affords us the opportunity to view an idea from a new perspective.  Inverses also play a crucial role in solving algebraic equations and in determining unknown parameters in models.  We emphasize the perspective that an inverse function is a process that reverses the process of the original function, as well as important basic functions that arise as inverses of other functions, especially logarithms and inverse trigonometric functions.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>Exact values versus approximate ones</em>.  The ability to represent numbers exactly is a powerful tool in mathematics.  We regularly and consistently distinguish between a number's exact value, such as <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, and its approximation, say <m>1.414</m>.  This idea is also closely tied to functions and function notation:  <m>e^{-1}</m>, <m>\cos(2)</m>, and <m>\ln(7)</m> are all symbolic representations of exact numbers that can only be approximated by a computer.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>Finding function formulas in applied settings</em>.  In applied settings with unknown variables, it's especially useful to be able to represent relationships among variables, since such relationships often lead to functions whose behavior we can study.  We work throughout <em>Active Prelude to Calculus</em> to ready students for problems in calculus that ask them to develop function formulas by observing relationships.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>Long-term trends, unbounded behavior, and limits</em>.  By working to study functions as objects themselves, we often focus on trends and overall behavior.  In addition to introducing the ideas of a function being increasing or decreasing, or concave up or concave down, we also focus on using algebraic approaces to comprehend function behavior where the input and/or output increase without bound.  In anticipation of calculus, we use limit notation and work to understand how this shorthand summarizes key features of functions.

        <title>Features of the Text</title>
        <p>
      Instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation,
      including:
      <dl width="narrow"><li>
          <title>Motivating Questions</title>
          <p>
            At the start of each section,
            we list 2<ndash/>3 <em>motivating questions</em>
            that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest to us.
            One goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating questions.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Preview Activities</title>
          <p>
            Each section of the text begins with a short introduction,
            followed by a <em>preview activity</em>.
            This brief reading and preview activity are designed to foreshadow the upcoming ideas in the remainder of the section;
            both the reading and preview activity are intended to be accessible to students
            <em>in advance</em> of class,
            and indeed to be completed by students before the particular section is to be considered
            in class.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Activities</title>
          <p>
            A typical section in the text has at least three <em>activities</em>.
            These are designed to engage students in an inquiry-based style that encourages them to construct solutions to key examples on their own,
            working in small groups or individually.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Exercises</title>
          <p>
            There are dozens of college algebra and trignometry texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises.
            Rather than repeat standard and routine exercises in this text,
            we recommend the use of
            <webwork/>
            with its access to the Open Problem Library (OPL) and many thousands of relevant problems.
            In this text,
            each section includes a small collection of anonymous <webwork/> exercises that offer
            students immediate feedback without penalty,
            as well as 3<ndash/>4 additional challenging exercises per section.
            Each of the non-<webwork/> exercises has multiple parts,
            requires the student to connect several key ideas,
            and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Graphics</title>
          <p>
            As much as possible,
            we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually,
            and to encourage students to do the same.
            Throughout the text, we use full-color<fn>To keep cost low,
            the graphics in the print-on-demand version are in black and white.
            When the text itself refers to color in images,
            one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically.</fn> graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas,
            and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Interactive graphics</title>
          <p>
            Many of the ideas of how functions behave are best understood dynamically;
            applets offer an often ideal format for investigations and demonstrations.
            <em>Desmos</em> provides a free and easy-to-use online graphing utility that we occasionally link to and often direct students to use.  Thanks to David Austin, there are also select interactive javascript figures within the text itself.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Summary of Key Ideas</title>
          <p>
            Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section;
            this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.

      This book is different.  
    </p>
        <p>
      The text is available in three different formats:  HTML, PDF, and print, each of which is available via links on the landing page at <url href="https://activecalculus.org/">https://activecalculus.org/</url>.  The first two formats are free.  If you are going to use the book electronically, the best mode is the <url href="https://activecalculus.org/prelude/">HTML</url>.  The HTML version looks great in any browser, including on a smartphone, and the links are much easier to navigate in HTML than in PDF.  Some particular direct suggestions about using the HTML follow among the next few paragraphs; alternatively, you can <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14i">watch this short video from the author</url> (based on using the text <pubtitle>Active Calculus</pubtitle>, which is similar).  It is also wise to download and save the PDF, since you can use the PDF offline, while the HTML version requires an internet connection.  An inexpensive print copy is available on <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/15y">Amazon</url>.
    </p>
        <p>
      This book is intended to be read sequentially and engaged with, much more than to be used as a lookup reference.  For example, each section begins with a short introduction and a Preview Activity; you should read the short introduction and complete the Preview Activity prior to class.  Your instructor may require you to do this.  Most Preview Activities can be completed in 15-20 minutes and are intended to be accessible based on the understanding you have from preceding sections. <!-- There are not answers provided to Preview Activities because ... -->    
    </p>
        <p>
      As you use the book, think of it as a workbook, not a worked-book.  There is a great deal of scholarship that shows people learn better when they interactively engage and struggle with ideas themselves, rather than passively watch others.  Thus, instead of reading worked examples or watching an instructor complete examples, you will engage with Activities that prompt you to grapple with concepts and develop deep understanding.  You should expect to spend time in class working with peers on Activities and getting feedback from them and from your instructor.  You can ask your instructor for a copy of the PDF file that has only the activities along with room to record your work.  Your goal should be to do all of the activities in the relevant sections of the text and keep a careful record of your work.  <!-- You can find answers to the activities <xref ref="activities-answers">in the back matter</xref>.-->
    </p>
        <p>
      Each section concludes with a Summary.  Reading the Summary after you have read the section and worked the Activities is a good way to find a short list of key ideas that are most essential to take from the section.  A good study habit is to write similar summaries in your own words.
    </p>
        <p>
      At the end of each section, you'll find two types of Exercises.  First, there are several anonymous <webwork/> exercises.  These are online, interactive exercises that allow you to submit answers for immediate feedback with unlimited attempts without penalty; to submit answers, you have to be using the HTML version of the text (see <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14i">this short video on the HTML version that includes a <webwork/> demonstration</url>).  You should use these exercises as a way to test your understanding of basic ideas in the preceding section.  If your institution uses <webwork/>, you may also need to log in to a server as directed by your instructor to complete assigned <webwork/> sets as part of your course grade.  The <webwork/> exercises included in this text are ungraded and not connected to any individual account.  Following the <webwork/> exercises there are 3-4 additional challenging exercises that are designed to encourage you to connect ideas, investigate new situations, and write about your understanding. <!-- There are answers to most of the non-<webwork /> exercises <xref ref="exercises-answers">in the back matter</xref>.-->

      The best way to be successful in mathematics generally and calculus specifically is to strive to make sense of the main ideas.  We make sense of ideas by asking questions, interacting with others, attempting to solve problems, making mistakes, revising attempts, and writing and speaking about our understanding.  This text has been designed to help you make sense of key ideas that are needed in calculus and to help you be well-prepared for success in calculus; we wish you the very best as you undertake the large and challenging task of doing so.

      Among the three formats (HTML, PDF, print), the HTML is optimal for display in class if you have a suitable projector.  The HTML is also best for navigation, as links to internal and external references are much more obvious.  We recommend saving a downloaded version of the PDF format as a backup in the event you don't have internet access.  It's a good idea for each student to have a printed version of the Activities Workbook, which you can acquire as a PDF document by direct request to the author (boelkinm at gvsu dot edu); many instructors use the PDF to have coursepacks printed for students to purchase from their local bookstore.

      The text is written so that, on average, one section corresponds to two hours of class meeting time.  A typical instructional sequence when starting a new section might look like the following:
      <ul><li>
          <p>
             Students complete a Preview Activity in advance of class.  Class begins with a short debrief among peers followed by all class discussion.  (5-10 minutes) 
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
             Brief lecture and discussion to build on the preview activity and set the stage for the next activity. (5-10 minutes) 
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
             Students engage with peers to work on and discuss the first activity in the section. (15-20 minutes) 
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
             Brief discussion and possibly lecture to reach closure on the preceding activity, followed by transition to new ideas.  (Varies, but 5-15 minutes)
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Possibly begin next activity.
          </p>
        </li></ul>
      The next hour of class would be similar, but without the Preview Activity to complete prior to class: the principal focus of class will be completing 2 activities.  Then rinse and repeat.
    </p>
        <p>
      We recommend that instructors use appropriate incentives to encourage students to complete Preview Activities prior to class.  Having these be part of completion-based assignments that count 5% of the semester grade usually results in the vast majority of students completing the vast majority of the previews.  If you'd like to see a sample syllabus for how to organize a course and weight various assignments, you can request one via email to the author.
    </p>
        <p>
      Note that the <webwork/> exercises in the HTML version are anonymous and there's not a way to track students' engagement with them.  These are intended to be formative for students and provide them with immediate feedback without penalty.  If your institution is a <webwork/> user, in the near future we will have sets of .def files that correspond to the sections in the text; these will be available upon request to the author.

          <p>
			Mathematics is the art of making sense of patterns.  One way that patterns arise is when two quantities are changing in tandem.  In this setting, we may make sense of the situation by expressing the relationship between the changing quantities through words, through images, through data, or through a formula.

			In <xref ref="PA-changing-aquarium">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw how several changing quantities were related in the setting of an aquarium filling with water: time, the depth of the water, and the total amount of water in the tank are all changing, and any pair of these quantities changes in related ways.  One way that we can make sense of the situation is to record some data in a table.  For instance, observing that the tank is filling at a rate of <m>0.5</m> cubic feet per minute, this tells us that after <m>1</m> minute there will be <m>0.5</m> cubic feet of water in the tank, and after <m>2</m> minutes there will be <m>1</m> cubic foot of water in the tank, and so on.  If we let <m>t</m> denote the time in minutes and <m>V</m> the amount of water in the tank at time <m>t</m>, we can represent the relationship between these quantities through <xref ref="T-tandem-aquarium">Table</xref>.

			Sometimes it is possible to use variables and one or more equations to connect quantities that are changing in tandem.

			<me>
				V = l \cdot w \cdot h
			</me>,
			and thus, since the water in the tank will always have length <m>l = 4</m> feet and width <m>w = 2</m> feet, the volume of water in the tank is directly related to the depth of water in the tank by the equation
			<me>
				V = 4 \cdot 2 \cdot h = 8h
			</me>.
			Depending on which variable we solve for, we can either see how <m>V</m> depends on <m>h</m> through the equation <m>V = 8h</m>, or how <m>h</m> depends on <m>V</m> via the equation <m>h = \frac{1}{8}V</m>.  From either perspective, we observe that as depth or volume increases, so must volume or depth correspondingly increase.

          <title>Using Algebra to Add Perspective</title>
          <p>
			One of the ways that we make sense of mathematical ideas is to view them from multiple perspectives.  We may use different means to establish different points of view:  words, numerical data, graphs, or symbols.  In addition, sometimes by changing our perspective within a particular approach we gain deeper insight.

          </sidebyside>
          <p>
			If we consider the conical tank discussed in <xref ref="act-tandem-conical-tank">Activity</xref>, as seen in <xref ref="F-tandem-empty-conical-tank">Figure</xref> and <xref ref="F-tandem-filled-conical-tank">Figure</xref>, we can use algebra to better understand some of the relationships among changing quantities.  The volume of a cone <idx><h>volume</h><h>cone</h></idx> with radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m> is given by the formula 
			<me>
				V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h
			</me>.
		</p>
          <p>
			Note that at any time while the tank is being filled, <m>r</m> (the radius of the surface of the water), <m>h</m> (the depth of the water), and <m>V</m> (the volume of the water) are all changing; moreover, all are connected to one another.  Because of the constraints of the tank itself (with radius <m>2</m> feet and depth <m>4</m> feet), it follows that as the radius and height of the water change, they always do so in the proportion
			<me>
				\frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{4}
			</me>.
			Solving this last equation for <m>r</m>, we see that <m>r = \frac{1}{2}h</m>; substituting this most recent result in the equation for volume, it follows that
			<me>
				V = \frac{1}{3}\pi \left( \frac{1}{2}h \right)^2 h = \frac{\pi}{12} h^3
			</me>.
		</p>
          <p>
			This most recent equation helps us understand how <m>V</m> and <m>h</m> change in tandem.  We know from our earlier work that the volume of water in the tank increases at a constant rate of <m>0.75</m> cubic feet per minute.  This leads to the data shown in <xref ref="T-tandem-cone-V-t">Table</xref>.

			<table xml:id="T-tandem-cone-V-t"><caption>How time and volume change in tandem in a conical tank.</caption><tabular><row bottom="minor"><cell><m>t</m></cell><cell><m>0</m></cell><cell><m>1</m></cell><cell><m>2</m></cell><cell><m>3</m></cell><cell><m>4</m></cell><cell><m>5</m></cell></row><row><cell><m>V</m></cell><cell><m>0.0</m></cell><cell><m>0.75</m></cell><cell><m>1.5</m></cell><cell><m>2.25</m></cell><cell><m>3.0</m></cell><cell><m>3.75</m></cell></row></tabular></table>
		</p>
          <p>
			With the equation <m>V = \frac{\pi}{12} h^3</m>, we can now also see how the height of the water changes in tandem with time.  Solving the equation for <m>h</m>, note that <m>h^3 = \frac{12}{\pi} V</m>, and therefore 
			<men xml:id="eq-height-from-volume">
				h = \sqrt[3]{\frac{12}{\pi} V}
			</men>.  Thus, when <m>V = 0.75</m>, it follows that <m>h = \sqrt[3]{\frac{12}{\pi} 0.75} \approx 1.42</m>.  Executing similar computations with the other values of <m>V</m> in <xref ref="T-tandem-cone-V-t">Table</xref>, we get the following updated data that now includes <m>h</m>.

			Plotting this data on two different sets of axes, we see the different ways that <m>V</m> and <m>h</m> change with <m>t</m>.  Whereas volume increases at a constant rate, as seen by the straight line appearance of the points in <xref ref="F-tandem-cone-V-t">Figure</xref>, we observe that the water's height increases in a way that it rises more slowly as time goes on, as shown by the way the curve the points lie on in <xref ref="F-tandem-cone-h-t">Figure</xref> <q>bends down</q> as time passes.

			<sidebyside width="50%"><figure xml:id="F-tandem-cone-V-t"><caption>Plotting <m>V</m> versus <m>t</m>.</caption><image source="images/tandem-cone-V-t" width="50%"/></figure><figure xml:id="F-tandem-cone-h-t"><caption>Plotting <m>h</m> versus <m>t</m>.</caption><image source="images/tandem-cone-h-t" width="50%"/></figure></sidebyside>
		</p>
          <p>
			These different behaviors make sense because of the shape of the tank.  Since at first there is less volume relative to depth near the cone's point, as water flows in at a constant rate, the water's height will rise quickly.  But as time goes on and more water is added at the same rate, there is more space for the water to fill in order to make the water level rise, and thus the water's heigh rises more and more slowly as time passes.

						When two related quantities are changing in tandem, we can better understand how change in one affects the other by using data, graphs, words, or algebraic symbols to express the relationship between them.  See, for instance, <xref ref="T-tandem-cone-V-t">Table</xref>,  <xref ref="F-tandem-cone-V-t">Figure</xref>, <xref ref="F-tandem-cone-h-t"/>, and <xref ref="eq-height-from-volume">Equation</xref> that together help explain how the height and volume of water in a conical tank change in tandem as time changes.
					</p>
				</li><li>
					<p>
						When the amount of water in a tank is changing, we can observe other quantities that change, depending on the shape of the tank.  For instance, if the tank is conical, we can consider both the changing height of the water and the changing radius of the surface of the water.  In addition, whenever we think about a quantity that is changing as time passes, we note that time itself is changing.

      <solution><alert> SOLUTION </alert>
      
      
      
      (a) At 80 mph, fuel consumption is about 24 mpg, so fuel used is
      <m>400  / 23.9188079597599 \approx 16.7 \ \mbox{gallons}</m>.
      
      
      
      (b) At 60 mph, fuel consumption is about 30 mpg, so fuel used on
      a 600 mile trip is
      <m>600  / 30 \approx 20.2 \mbox{ gallons}</m>.
      At 70 mph, fuel consumption is about 27 mpg, so fuel used on this trip
      is <m>600  / 27 \approx 22.1 \mbox{ gallons}</m>.
      Altogether we would then save
      <m>22.1 - 20.2 \approx 1.9 \mbox{ gallons}</m>.
      
      
      
      (c) The most fuel efficient speed is where mpg is a maximum, which is
      about 55 mph.

        <introduction>
          <p>
  		A mathematical model is an abstract concept through which we use mathematical language and notation to describe a phenomenon in the world around us.  One example of a mathematical model is found in <em>Dolbear's Law</em><fn>You can read more in the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolbear%27s_law">Wikipedia entry</url> for Dolbear's Law, which has proven to be remarkably accurate for the behavior of snowy tree crickets.  For even more of the story, including a reference to this phenomenon on the popular show <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, see <url href="https://priceonomics.com/how-to-tell-the-temperature-using-crickets/">this article.</url></fn>. <idx>Dolbear's Law</idx>  In the late 1800s, the physicist Amos Dolbear was listening to crickets chirp and noticed a pattern: how frequently the crickets chirped seemed to be connected to the outside temperature.  If we let <m>T</m> represent the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and <m>N</m> the number of chirps per minute, we can summarize Dolbear's observations in the following table.
  	</p>
          <p>
		<table xml:id="T-functions-Dolbear"><caption>Data for Dolbear's observations.</caption><tabular><row bottom="minor"><cell><m>N</m> (chirps per minute)</cell><cell><m>40</m></cell><cell><m>80</m></cell><cell><m>120</m></cell><cell><m>160</m></cell></row><row><cell><m>T</m> (<m>^\circ</m> Fahrenheit)</cell><cell><m>50^\circ</m></cell><cell><m>60^\circ</m></cell><cell><m>70^\circ</m></cell><cell><m>80^\circ</m></cell></row></tabular></table>		
	</p>
          <p>
		For a mathematical model, we often seek an algebraic formula that captures observed behavior accurately and can be used to predict behavior not yet observed.  For the data in <xref ref="T-functions-Dolbear">Table</xref>, we observe that each of the ordered pairs in the table make the equation 
		<men xml:id="eq-functions-Dolbear">
			T = 40 + 0.25N
		</men> 
		true.  For instance, <m>70 = 40 + 0.25(120)</m>.  Indeed, scientists who made many additional cricket chirp observations following Dolbear's initial counts found that the formula in <xref ref="eq-functions-Dolbear">Equation</xref> holds with remarkable accuracy for the snowy tree cricket in temperatures ranging from about <m>50^\circ</m> F to <m>85^\circ</m> F.

          <title>Functions</title>
          <p>
  		The mathematical concept of a <em>function</em> <idx><h>function</h><h>introduction to</h></idx> is one of the most central ideas in all of mathematics, in part since functions provide an important tool for representing and explaining patterns.  At its core, a function is a repeatable process that takes a collection of input values and generates a corresponding collection of output values with the property that if we use a particular single input, the process always produces exactly the same single output.  
	</p>
          <p>
  		For instance, Dolbear's Law in <xref ref="eq-functions-Dolbear">Equation</xref> provides a process that takes a given number of chirps between <m>40</m> and <m>180</m> per minute and reliably produces the corresponding temperature that corresponds to the number of chirps, and thus this equation generates a function.  We often give functions shorthand names; using <q><m>D</m></q> for the <q>Dolbear</q> function, we can represent the process of taking inputs (observed chirp rates) to outputs (corresponding temperatures) using arrows:
  		<md><mrow>
  				80 &amp;\xrightarrow{D} 60
  			</mrow><mrow>
  				120 &amp;\xrightarrow{D} 70
  			</mrow><mrow>
  				N &amp;\xrightarrow{D} 40 + 0.25 N
  			</mrow></md>
  		Alternatively, for the relationship <q><m>80 \xrightarrow{D} 60</m></q> we can also use the equivalent notation <q><m>D(80) = 60</m></q> to indicate that Dolbear's Law takes an input of <m>80</m> chirps per minute and produces a corresponding output of <m>60</m> degrees Fahrenheit.  More generally, we write <q><m>T = D(N) = 40 + 0.25N</m></q> to indicate that a certain temperature, <m>T</m>, is determined by a given number of chirps per minute, <m>N</m>, according to the process <m>D(N) = 40 + 0.25N</m>.
  	</p>

		Tables and graphs are particularly valuable ways to characterize and represent functions.  For the current example, we summarize some of the data the Dolbear function generates in <xref ref="T-functions-Dolbear-data">Table</xref> and plot that data along with the underlying curve in <xref ref="F-functions-Dolbear-data">Figure</xref>.

			When a point such as <m>(120,70)</m> in <xref ref="F-functions-Dolbear-data">Figure</xref> lies on a function's graph, this indicates the correspondence between input and output:  when the value <m>120</m> chirps per minute is entered in the function <m>D</m>, the result is <m>70</m> degrees Fahrenheit.

			In many situations, the range of a function is much more challenging to determine than its codomain.  For the Dolbear function, the range is straightforward to find by using the graph shown in <xref ref="F-functions-Dolbear-data">Figure</xref>:  since the actual outputs of <m>D</m> fall between <m>T = 50</m> and <m>T = 85</m> and include every value in that interval, the range of <m>D</m> is <m>[50,80]</m>.
		</p>
          <p>
			The range of any function is always a subset of the codomain.  It is possible for the range to equal the codomain.

          <title>Comparing models and abstract functions</title>
          <p>
		Again, a mathematical model is an abstract concept through which we use mathematical language and notation to describe a phenomenon in the world around us.  So far, we have considered two different examples:  the Dolbear function, <m>T = D(N) = 40 + 0.25N</m>, that models how Fahrenheit temperature is a function of the number of cricket chirps per minute and the function <m>V = f(h) = \frac{\pi}{3}h^2(12-h)</m> that models how the volume of water in a spherical tank of radius <m>4</m> m is a function of the depth of the water in the tank.  While often we consider a function in the physical setting of some model, there are also many occasions where we consider an abstract function for its own sake in order to study and understand it.

				For this abstract function, its domain is <q>all real numbers</q> since we may input any real number <m>x</m> we wish into the formula <m>f(x) = -16x^2 + 32x + 48</m> and have the result be defined.  Moreover, taking a real number <m>x</m> and processing it in the formula <m>f(x) = -16x^2 + 32x + 48</m> will produce another real number.  This tells us that the codomain of the abstract function <m>f</m> is also <q>all real numbers.</q>  Finally, from the graph and the data, we observe that the largest possible output of the function <m>f</m> is <m>y = 64</m>.  It is apparent that we can generate any <m>y</m>-value less than or equal to <m>64</m>, and thus the range of the abstract function <m>f</m> is all real numbers less than or equal to <m>64</m>.  We denote this collection of real numbers using the shorthand interval notation <m>(-\infty, 64]</m>.<fn>The notation <m>(-infty,64]</m> stands for all the real numbers that lie to the left of an including <m>64</m>.  The <q><m>-\infty</m></q> indicates that there is no left-hand bound on the interval.</fn>

				Next, we turn our attention to the model <m>h = g(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 48</m> that represents the height of the ball, <m>h</m>, in feet <m>t</m> seconds after the ball in initially launched.  Here, the big difference is the domain, codomain, and range associated with the model.  Since the model takes effect once the ball is tossed, it only makes sense to consider the model for input values <m>t \ge 0</m>.  Moreover, because the model ceases to apply once the ball lands, it is only valid for <m>t \le 3</m>.  Thus, the domain of <m>g</m> is <m>[0,3]</m>.  For the codomain, it only makes sense to consider values of <m>h</m> that are nonnegative.  That is, as we think of <em>potential</em> outputs for the model, then can only be in the interval <m>[0, \infty)</m>.  Finally, we can consider the graph of the model on the given domain in <xref ref="F-functions-quadratic-model-data">Figure</xref> and see that the range of the model is <m>[0,64]</m>, the collection of all heights between its lowest (ground level) and its largest (at the vertex).

          <p>
  		To this point in our discussion of functions, we have mostly focused on what the function process may model and what the domain, codomain, and range of a model or abstract function are.  It is also important to take note of another part of <xref ref="def-function-process">Definition</xref>: <q><m>\ldots</m> the process produces one and only one output value for any single input value</q>.  Said differently, if a relationship or process ever associates a single input with two or more different outputs, the process cannot be a function. 
  	</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-functions-people-phone-numbers">
            <statement>
              <p>
				Is the relationship between people and phone numbers a function?
			</p>
              <p>
				<em>Solution</em>.  No, this relationship is not a function.  A given individual person can be associated with more than one phone number, such as their cell phone and their work telephone.  This means that we can't view phone numbers as a function of people:  one input (a person) can lead to two different outputs (phone numbers).  We also can't view people as a function of phone numbers, since more than one person can be associated with a phone number, such as when a family shares a single phone at home.

		For a relationship or process to be a function, each individual input must be associated with one and only one output.  Thus, the usual way that we demonstrate a relationship or process is not a function is to find a particular input that is associated with two or more outputs.  When the relationship is given graphically, such as in <xref ref="F-functions-act-is-it-1">Figure</xref>, we can use the vertical line test to determine whether or not the graph represents a function.
	</p>
          <assemblage xml:id="asm-functions-V-L-test">
		<title>Vertical Line Test</title>
		<idx><h>vertical line test</h></idx>
		<p>
			A graph in the plane represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph at most once.  When the graph passes this test, the vertical coordinate of each point on the graph can be viewed as a function of the horizontal coordinate of the point.
		</p>
	</assemblage>
          <p>
		Since the vertical line <m>x = -3</m> passes through the circle in <xref ref="F-functions-act-is-it-1">Figure</xref> at both <m>y = -\sqrt{7}</m> and <m>y = \sqrt{7}</m>, the circle does not represent a relationship where <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>.  However, since any vertical line we draw in <xref ref="F-functions-act-is-it-2">Figure</xref> intersects the blue curve at most one time, the graph indeed represents a function.
	</p>
          <p>

		When we use a computing device such as <em>Desmos</em> to graph a function <m>g</m>, the program is generating a large collection of ordered pairs <m>(x,g(x))</m>, plotting them in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane, and connecting the points with short line segments.

	  				A function is a process that generates a relationship between two collections of quantities.  The function associates each member of a collection of input values with one and only one member of the collection of output values.  A function can be described or defined by words, by a table of values, by a graph, or by a formula.
	  			</p>
	  		</li>
            <li>
	  			<p>
	  				Functions may be viewed as mathematical objects worthy of study for their own sake and also as models that represent physical phenomena in the world around us.  Every function or model has a domain (the set of possible or allowable input values), a codomain (the set of possible output values), and a range (the set of all actual output values).  Both the codomain and range depend on the domain.  For an abstract function, the domain is usually viewed as the largest reasonable collection of input values; for a function that models a physical phenomenon, the domain is usually determined by the context of possibilities for the input in the phenomenon being considered.

      <solution><alert> SOLUTION </alert>
      
      
      
      a) <m>f(20) = 110.1</m> because when the entry in the top row is 20 , the corresponding entry below it is 110.1.
      
      
      
      b) The value 110.1 from part (a) indicates the total value (in billions of dollars) of $20 bills in circulation, not the number of $20 bills.  The total number (in billions) of $20 bills in circulation equals the total value in circulation, <em> f(20) </em> = 110.1, divided by 20 (the value of each $20 bill):
      <me>\frac{ 110.1 }{ 20 } = 5.505 \mbox{ billion $20 bills}.</me>
      
      
      
      c)  Using the same logic as in (b) calculate the number of each bill in circulation by finding the total value in circulation, <m>f(d)</m>, and dividing by the value of the bill, <m>d</m>.  Then compare the number of each bill in circulation,   <m>\frac{ f(d) }{d}</m> , for the given values of <m>d</m> in order to determine whether the statements are true or false.

      a) The input 4 corresponds to the number of minutes past 5 PM, and the output 21 indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at this time.  Thus the mathematical expression <m>f( 4 ) = 21</m> means there are 21 people eating at 5:04 PM.
      
      
      
      b)   The output 20 indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at a particular time (in minutes after 5 PM).  Thus the mathematical expression <m>f(a) = 20</m> means <m>a</m> minutes after 5 PM there are 20 people eating.
      
      
      
      c)  The input 20 corresponds to the number of minutes past 5 PM.  Thus the mathematical expression <m>f( 20 ) = b</m> means there are <m>b</m> people eating at 5:20 PM.
      
      
      
      d) The <m>t</m> corresponds to the time (in number of minutes past 5 PM), and the output <m>n</m> indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at this time.  Thus the mathematical expression <m>n = f(t)</m> indicates there are <m>n</m> people eating in the restaurant <m>t</m> minutes past 5 PM.  None of these statements explain this correctly, so the answer is None of the above.

      (a) The table shows <m>f(8)=3.4</m>, so <m>t=8</m>.
      Chicago's average rainfall in the month of August
      is 3.4 inches.
      
      
      
      (b) First evaluate <m>f(4)=3.5</m>. Solving <m>f(t)=3.5</m> gives
      <m>t=5</m> or <m>t=7</m>. Chicago's average rainfall is 3.5 inches in
      May and July.

      (a) No.  For many of the values of <m>F</m> in the table, such as <m>F = 100</m>, there are multiple values of <m>t</m> for which <m>F = 100</m> (namely when <m>t=2</m> and <m>t=10</m>).
      
      
      
      (b) When <m>g(t) = 125</m> there are 125 foxes.  We want to know
      what month there are 125 foxes.  The table tells us that this occurs
      when <m>t=2</m> and <m>t=10</m> .  This means the population of foxes is 125 in March and November.

              <p>
        Consider an inverted conical tank (point down) whose top has a radius of <m>3</m> feet and that is <m>2</m> feet deep.  The tank is initially empty and then is filled at a constant rate of <m>0.75</m> cubic feet per minute.  Let <m>V=f(t)</m> denote the volume of water (in cubic feet) at time <m>t</m> in minutes, and let <m>h= g(t)</m> denote the depth of the water (in feet) at time <m>t</m>.

        <ol label="a."><li>
            <p>
              Recall that the volume of a conical tank of radius <m>r</m> and depth <m>h</m> is given by the formula <m>V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h</m>.  How long will it take for the tank to be completely full and how much water will be in the tank at that time?
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              On the provided axes, sketch possible graphs of both <m>V = f(t)</m> and <m>h = g(t)</m>, making them as accurate as you can.  Label the scale on your axes and points whose coordinates you know for sure; write at least one sentence for each graph to discuss the shape of your graph and why it makes sense in the context of the model.

              It's possible to show that the formula for the function <m>g</m> is <m>g(t) = \left( \frac{t}{\pi} \right)^{1/3}</m>.  Use a computational device to generate two plots:  on the axes at left, the graph of the model <m>h = g(t) = \left( \frac{t}{\pi} \right)^{1/3}</m> on the domain that you decided in (c); on the axes at right, the graph of the abstract function <m>y = p(x) = \left( \frac{t}{\pi} \right)^{1/3}</m> on a wider domain than that of <m>g</m>.  What are the domain and range of <m>p</m> and how do these differ from those of the physical model <m>g</m>?

        <introduction>
          <p>
    		Given a function that models a certain phenomenon,
    		it's natural to ask such questions as
  			<q>how is the function changing on a given interval</q> or
    		<q>on which interval is the function changing more rapidly?</q>
    		The concept of <em>average rate of change</em>
    		enables us to make these questions more mathematically precise.
    		Initially, we will focus on the average rate of change of an object moving along a straight-line path.
  		</p>
          <p>
  			For a function <m>s</m> that tells the location of a moving object along a straight path at time <m>t</m>, we define the average rate of change of <m>s</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> to be the quantity 
  			<me>
  				AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}
  			</me>.
  			<idx><h>average rate of change</h><h>of position</h></idx>
  			Note particularly that the average rate of change of <m>s</m> on <m>[a,b]</m> is measuring the
    		<em>change in position</em> divided by the <em>change in time</em>.

          <p>
			In the context of a function that measures height or position of a moving object at a given time,
    		the meaning of the average rate of change of the function on a given interval is the <em>average velocity</em> <idx><h>average velocity</h></idx> of the moving object
    		because it is the ratio of <em>change in position</em> to <em>change in time</em>.  For example, in <xref ref="PA-changing-aroc">Preview Activity</xref>, the units on <m>AV_{[1.5,2.5]} = -32</m> are <q>feet per second</q> since the units on the numerator are <q>feet</q> and on the denominator <q>seconds</q>.  Morever, <m>-32</m> is numerically the same value as the slope of the line that connects the two corresponding points on the graph of the position function, as seen in <xref ref="F-aroc-s-t-ex-1">Figure</xref>.  The fact that the average rate of change is negative in this example indicates that the ball is falling.

		    While the average rate of change of a position function tells us the moving object's average velocity, in other contexts,

			The average rate of change of a function on an interval gives us an excellent way to describe how the function behaves, on average.  For instance, if we compute <m>AV_{[1970,2000]}</m> for Kent County, we find that 
			<me>
				AV_{[1970,2000]} = \frac{574,336 - 411,044}{30} = 5443.07
			</me>,
			which tells us that in an average year from 1970 to 2000, the population of Kent County increased by about <m>5443</m> people.  Said differently, we could also say that from 1970 to 2000, Kent County was growing at an average rate of <m>5443</m> people per year.  These ideas also afford the opportunity to make comparisons over time.  Since
			<me>
				AV_{[1990,2000]} = \frac{574,336 - 500,631}{10} = 7370.5
			</me>,
			we can not only say that Kent county's population increased by about <m>7370</m> in an average year between 1990 and 2000, but also that the population was growing faster from 1990 to 2000 than it did from 1970 to 2000.
		</p>
          <p>
			Finally, we can even use the average rate of change of a function to predict future behavior.  Since the population was changing on average by <m>7370.5</m> people per year from 1990 to 2000, we can estimate that the population in 2002 is 
			<me>
				K(2002) \approx K(2000) + 2 \cdot 7370.5 = 574,336 + 14,741 = 589,077
			</me>.

          <title>How average rate of change indicates function trends</title>
          <p>
			We have already seen that it is natural to use words such as <q>increasing</q> and <q>decreasing</q> to describe a function's behavior.  For instance, for the tennis ball whose height is modeled by <m>s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2</m>, we computed that <m>AV_{[1.5,2.5]} = -32</m>, which indicates that on the interval <m>[1.5,2.5]</m>, the tennis ball's height is decreasing at an average rate of <m>32</m> feet per second.  Similarly, for the population of Kent County, since <m>AV_{[1990,2000]} = 7370.5</m>, we know that on the interval <m>[1990,2000]</m> the population is increasing at an average rate of <m>7370.5</m> people per year.

			It is helpful be able to connect information about a function's average rate of change and its graph.  For instance, if we have determined that <m>AV_{[-3,2]} = 1.75</m> for some function <m>f</m>, this tells us that, on average, the function rises between the points <m>x = -3</m> and <m>x = 2</m> and does so at an average rate of <m>1.75</m> vertical units for every horizontal unit.  Moreover, we can even determine that the difference between <m>f(2)</m> and <m>f(-3)</m> is
			<me>
				f(2)-f(-3) = 1.75 \cdot 5 = 8.75
			</me>
			since <m>\frac{f(2)-f(-3)}{2-(-3)} = 1.75</m>.

  				The value of <m>AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}</m> tells us how much the function rises or falls, on average, for each additional unit we move to the right on the graph.  For instance, if <m>AV_{[3,7]} = 0.75</m>, this means that for additional <m>1</m>-unit increase in the value of <m>x</m> on the interval <m>[3,7]</m>, the function increases, on average, by <m>0.75</m> units.

      (a) Over the first interval 2005 to 2008, <m>\Delta y = 130 - 45 = 85</m> and <m>\Delta x = 2008 - 2005 = 3</m> .  Thus the average rate of change during this interval is <m>\frac{ \Delta y }{ \Delta x} = \frac{85}{3}</m>.
      
      
      
      (b) Over the interval 2008 to 2012, <m>\Delta y = 50 - 130 = -80</m> and <m>\Delta x = 2012 - 2008 = 4</m> .  Thus the average rate of change during this interval is <m>\frac{ \Delta y }{ \Delta x} = -20</m>.
      
      
      
      (c) Over the interval 2005 to 2012, <m>\Delta y = 50 - 45 = 5</m> and <m>\Delta x = 2012 - 2005 = 7</m> .  Thus the average rate of change during this interval is <m>\frac{ \Delta y }{ \Delta x} = \frac{5}{7}</m>.

      The average rate of change of a function <m>f(x)</m> over an interval <m>a \leq x \leq b</m> is computed using the following formula:
      <me>\mbox{Average Rate of Change of f(x) over } a \leq x \leq b = \frac{ \Delta f }{\Delta x} = \frac{ f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}</me>
      
      
      
      
      a) Using the formula above with the endpoints (2.2, 2.9) and ( 6.1, 4.9 ) we obtain the following answer:
      <me>\mbox{Average Rate of Change of f(x) over } 2.2 \leq x \leq 6.1 = \frac{ 4.9 - 2.9}{6.1 - 2.2} = \frac{ 2}{3.9}</me>
      
      
      
      
      b) Using the formula above with the endpoints (2.2, 2.9) and ( 6.1, 4.9 ) we obtain the following answer:
      <me>\mbox{Average Rate of Change of g(x) over } 2.2 \leq x \leq 6.1 = \frac{ 4.9 - 2.9}{6.1 - 2.2} = \frac{2}{3.9}</me></solution>

      a) Over the first interval <m>t  = 1.5</m> to <m>t = 4.5</m>,       <m>\Delta D = 180 - 60 = 120</m> and <m>\Delta t = 4.5 - 1.5 = 3</m> .  
      
      
      Similarly, over the second interval <m>t = 2</m> to <m>t = 4.5</m>,       <m>\Delta D = 180 - 80 = 100</m> and <m>\Delta t = 4.5 - 2 = 2.5</m> .  
      
      
      Finally, over the last interval <m>t = 1</m> to <m>t = 3</m>,       <m>\Delta D = 120 - 40 = 80</m> and <m>\Delta t = 3 - 1 = 2</m> .
      
      
      
      b) Notice that for each of the three intervals in (a) (as well as any other interval), <m>\frac{ \Delta D }{ \Delta t} = 40</m>.
      
      
      
      c)  There are three correct statements: It represents the car's velocity, It is the average velocity of the car over the first two hours, and It is the slope of the line.

      ii) <m>\frac{f( 6 ) - f( 4 ) }{ 6 - 4 } = \frac{ 0 - 20}{6 - 4} = \frac{ -20 }{ 2} =  -10</m>
      
      
      
      iii) <m>\frac{f( 6 ) - f(0)}{ 6 - 0} = \frac{ 0 - 36 }{ 6 - 0} = \frac{ -20 }{ 6} =  -6</m>
      
      
      
      b) The formulas in parts (i), (ii), and (iii) represent the average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> over the intervals <m>0 \leq x \leq 4</m> , <m>4 \leq x \leq 6</m> , and <m>0 \leq x \leq 6</m> respectively.  Thus line segment D connecting the points (0, 36 ) and ( 4, 20 ) illustrates formula (i), line segment C connecting the points ( 4, 20 ) and ( 6, 0 ) illustrates formula (ii), and line segment B connecting the points (0, 36 ) and ( 6, 0 ) illustrates formula (iii).

      <solution><alert> SOLUTION </alert>
      
      
      
      a) Over the interval   <m>d  = 125</m>   to   <m>d = 275</m>,     <m>\Delta T = 6.75 - 5.30 = 1.45</m>   and   <m>\Delta d = 275 - 125 = 150</m> .  
      
      
            Thus   <m>\Delta T / \Delta d = 1.45/150</m> .  
      
      
      b) Over the interval   <m>d  = 25</m>   to   <m>d = 125</m>,     <m>\Delta T = 5.30 - 5.50 = -0.2</m>   and   <m>\Delta d = 125 - 25 = 100</m> .  
      
      
            Thus   <m>\Delta T / \Delta d = -0.2/100</m> .  
      
      
      c) Over the interval   <m>d  = 75</m>   to   <m>d = 200</m>,     <m>\Delta T = 6.00 - 5.10 = 0.9</m>   and   <m>\Delta d = 200 - 75 = 125</m> .  
      
      
            Thus   <m>\Delta T / \Delta d = 0.9/125</m> .  
      
      
      d)  Only the statement <em> Over the interval from 75 meters to 200 meters, the temperature changes on average at a rate of 0.0072 degrees Celsius per meter </em> is correct.  All others are incorrect:
      
      
      
      The statement, 0.0072 is the slope of the graph of at <em> d </em> = 75, is incorrect since the average rate of change is the slope of the line segment connect the endpoints of the interval.
      
      
      
      The statement, The temperature changes by a total of 0.0072 degrees Celsius when moving from a depth 75 meters to 200 meters, is incorrect since the average rate of change is a ratio of the change in temperature divided by the change in depth (not just the total change in temperature.
      
      
      
      The statement, On average the temperature is changing at a rate of 0.0072 degrees Celsius per minute over the interval <m>75 \leq d \leq 200</m>, is incorrect since the units must be degrees Celsius per meter (not minute).
      
      
      
      The statement, The temperature is changing at a rate of 0.0072 degrees Celsius per minute when the depth is 75 meters, is incorrect since the average rate of change averages the rates of change at every point in the interval.  It is not the rate of the change at just the initial depth.

          <p>
  		Functions whose graphs are straight lines are both the simplest and the most important functions in mathematics.
    	Lines often model important phenomena,
    	and even when they don't directly model phenomena,
    	lines can often approximate other functions that do.
    	Whether a function's graph is a straight line or not is connected directly to its average rate of change.

          <title>Properties of linear functions</title>
          <p>
		In <xref ref="PA-changing-linear-3-ex">Preview Activity</xref>, we considered three different functions for which the average rate of change of each appeared to always be constant.  For the first function in the preview activity, <m>y = f(x) = 7 - 3x</m>, we can compute its average rate of change on an arbitrary interval <m>[a,b]</m>.  Doing so, we notice that
		<md><mrow>AV_{[a,b]} &amp;= \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}</mrow><mrow> 		&amp;= \frac{(7-3b) - (7-3a)}{b-a}</mrow><mrow> 		&amp;= \frac{7-3b - 7+3a}{b-a}</mrow><mrow> 		&amp;= \frac{-3b + 3a}{b-a}</mrow><mrow> 		&amp;= \frac{-3(b - a)}{b-a}</mrow><mrow> 		&amp;= -3</mrow></md>.
		This result shows us that for the function <m>y = f(x) = 7 - 3x</m>, its average rate of change is always <m>-3</m>, regardless of the interval we choose.  We will use the property of having constant rate of change as the defining property of a linear function.

That is, for any inputs <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> for which <m>a \ne b</m>, it follows that 
				<me>
					\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} = m

          <p>
		From prior study, we already know a lot about linear functions.  In this section, we work to understand some familiar properties in light of the new perspective of <xref ref="D-linear-function">Definition</xref>.
	</p>
          <p>
		Let's suppose we know that a function <m>f</m> is linear with average rate of change <m>AV_{[a,b]} = m</m> and that we also know the function value is <m>y_0</m> at some fixed input <m>x_0</m>.  That is, we know that <m>f(x_0) = y_0</m>.  From this information, we can find the formula for <m>y = f(x)</m> for <em>any</em> input <m>x</m>.  Working with the known point <m>(x_0, f(x_0))</m> and any other point <m>(x,f(x))</m> on the function's graph, we know that the average rate of change between these two points must be the constant <m>m</m>.  This tells us that 
		<me>
			\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x-x_0} = m
		</me>.
		Since we are interested in finding a formula for <m>y = f(x)</m>, we solve this most recent equation for <m>f(x)</m>.  Multiplying both sides by <m>(x-x_0)</m>, we see that
		<me>
			f(x) - f(x_0) = m(x-x_0)
		</me>.
		Adding <m>f(x_0)</m> to each side, it follows
		<men xml:id="E-linear-point-slope-first-take">
			f(x) = f(x_0) + m(x-x_0)
		</men>.
		This shows that to determine the formula for a linear function, all we need to know is its average rate of change (or slope) and a single point the function passes through.

			</p>
              <p>
				<em>Solution</em>.  Using <xref ref="E-linear-point-slope-first-take">Equation</xref> and the facts that <m>m = -\frac{1}{4}</m> and <m>f(-7) = -5</m> (that is, <m>x_0 = -7</m> and <m>f(x_0) = -5</m>), we have
				<me>
					f(x) = -5 -\frac{1}{4}(x - (-7)) = 5 - \frac{1}{4}(x+7)

		Visualizing the various components of point-slope form is important.  For a line through <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> with slope <m>m</m>, we know its equation is <m>y = y_0 + m(x-x_0)</m>.  In <xref ref="F-linear-point-slope">Figure</xref>, we see that the line passes through <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> along with an arbitary point <m>(x,y)</m>, which makes the vertical change between the two points given by <m>y - y_0</m> and the horizontal change between the points <m>x - x_0</m>. This is consistent with the fact that
		<me>
			AV_{[x_0,x]} = m = \frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}
		</me>.
		Indeed, writing <m>m = \frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}</m> is a rearrangement of the point-slope form of the line, <m>y = y_0 + m(x-x_0)</m>.	
	</p>
          <p>
		We naturally use the terms <q>increasing</q> and <q>decreasing</q> as from <xref ref="D-aroc-increasing-decreasing">Definition</xref> to describe lines based on whether their slope is positive or negative.  A line with positive slope, such as the one in <xref ref="F-linear-point-slope">Figure</xref>, is increasing because its constant rate of change is positive, while a line with negative slope, such as in <xref ref="F-linear-slope-intercept">Figure</xref> is decreasing because of its negative rate of change.  We say that a horizontal line (one whose slope is <m>m = 0</m>) is neither increasing nor decreasing.

		A special case arises when the known point on a line satisfies <m>x_0 = 0</m>.  In this situation, the known point lies on the <m>y</m>-axis, and thus we call the point the <q><m>y</m>-intercept</q> of the line. <idx><h>line</h><h><m>y</m>-intercept</h></idx>  The resulting form of the line's equation is called <em>slope-intercept form</em>, which is also demonstrated in <xref ref="F-linear-slope-intercept">Figure</xref>.

		Slope-intercept form follows from point-slope form from the fact that replacing <m>x_0</m> with <m>0</m> gives us <m>y = y_0 + m(x-0) = y_0 + mx</m>.  In many textbooks, the slope-intercept form of a line (often written <m>y = mx + b</m>) is treated as if it is the most useful form of a line.  Point-slope form is actually more important and valuable since we can easily write down the equation of a line as soon as we know its slope and <em>any</em> point that lies on it, as opposed to needing to find the <m>y</m>-intercept, which is needed for slope-intercept form.  Moreover, point-slope form plays a prominent role in calculus.
	</p>
          <p>
		If a line is in slope-intercept or point-slope form, it is useful to be able to quickly interpret key information about the line from the form of its equation.

				<em>Solution</em>.  This line is in slope-intercept form.  Its slope is <m>m = 0.25</m> and a point on the line is <m>(0,6)</m>, which is also the line's <m>y</m>-intercept.

          <title>Interpreting linear functions in context</title>
          <p>
  		Since linear functions are defined by the property that their average rate of change is constant, linear functions perfectly model quantities that change at a constant rate.  In context, we can often think of slope as a rate of change; analyzing units carefully often yields significant insight.
  	</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-linear-Dolbear">
            <statement>
              <p>
  				The Dolbear function <m>T = D(N) = 40 + 0.25N</m> from <xref ref="sec-changing-functions-models">Section</xref> is a linear function whose slope is <m>m = 0.25</m>.  What is the meaning of the slope in this context?
  			</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
  				Recall that <m>T</m> is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and <m>N</m> in chirps per minute.  We know that <m>m = AV_{[a,b]} = 0.25</m> is the constant average rate of change of <m>D</m>.  Its units are <q>units of output per unit of input</q>, and thus <q>degrees Fahrenheit per chirp per minute</q>.  This tells us that the average rate of change of the temperature function is <m>0.25</m> degrees Fahrenheit per chirp per minute, which means that for each additional chirp per minute observed, we expect the temperature to rise by <m>0.25</m> degrees Fahrenheit.
  			</p>
              <sidebyside width="50%">
                <p>
					Indeed, we can observe this through function values.  We note that <m>T(60) = 55</m> and <m>T(61) = 55.25</m>:  one additional observed chirp per minute corresponds to a <m>0.25</m> degree increase in temperature.  We also see this in the graph of the line, as seen in <xref ref="F-linear-ex-Dolbear-slope">Figure</xref>:
					the slope between the points <m>(40,50)</m> and <m>(120,70)</m> is
	  				<md><mrow>m &amp;= \frac{70-50}{120-40}</mrow><mrow> &amp;= \frac{20}{80}</mrow><mrow> &amp;= 0.25 \frac{\text{degrees F}}{\text{chirp per minute}}</mrow></md>.

            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
		Like with the Dolbear function, it is often useful to write a linear function (whose output is called <m>y</m>) that models a quantity changing at a constant rate (as a function of some input <m>t</m>) by writing the function relationship in the form
		<me>
			y = b + mt
		</me>
		where <m>b</m> and <m>m</m> are constants.  We may think of the four quantities involved in the following way:
	</p>
          <p>
		<ul><li>
				<p>
					The constant <m>b</m> is the <q>starting value</q> of the output that corresponds to an input of <m>t = 0</m>;
				</p>
			</li><li>
				<p>
					The constant <m>m</m> is the rate at which the output changes with respect to changes in the input:  for each additional <m>1</m>-unit change in input, the output will change by <m>m</m> units.
				</p>
			</li><li>
				<p>
					The variable <m>t</m> is the independent (input) variable.  A nonzero value for <m>t</m> corresponds to how much the input variable has changed from an initial value of <m>0</m>.
				</p>
			</li><li>
				<p>
					The variable <m>y</m> is the dependent (output) variable.  The value of <m>y</m> results from a particular choice of <m>t</m>, and can be thought of as the starting output value (<m>b</m>) plus the change in output that results from the corresponding change in input <m>t</m>.
				</p>
			</li></ul>

      <solution><alert>  SOLUTION </alert>
      
      
      
      (a) <m>r(5) = 600 - 30(5)=450</m>.
      
      
      
      (b) <m>r(5) = 450</m> means water is entering the reservoir at 450 gallons
      per second at time <m>t = 5</m> seconds.
      
      
      
      (c) The vertical intercept first tells us that at time <m>t = 0</m> seconds,
      the water is initially flowing in at the rate of 600 gallons
      per second.
      
      
      The horizontal intercept tells us that at <m>600/30 \approx 20</m> seconds,
      the flow has stopped.
      
      
      The slope is <m>-30</m>.  This means that the rate  at which water enters the
      reservoir decreases by 30 gallons per second each second. The water is
      flowing in at a decreasing rate.
      
      
      
      (d) The reservoir has more and more water when the rate, <m>r(t)</m>, is
      positive because water is being added. Water is being added until
      <m>t = 600/30</m> seconds later when it starts flowing out. This means at
      <m>t = 600/30</m>, the most water is in the reservoir.
      
      
      
      (e) The reservoir has water draining out between <m>t= 600/30</m> and
      <m>t= 30</m>, but this amount is not as much as the water that entered
      between <m>t=0</m> and <m>t=600/30</m>. Thus, the reservoir had the least
      amount of water at the beginning when <m>t=0</m>. Remember the function
      <m>r(t)</m> gives the rate of flow, not the amount of water in the reservoir.
      
      
      
      (f) If the domain is specified as <m>0 \leq t \leq 30</m> , then  the
      rate varies from 600 gallons per second  at <m>t=0</m> to -300 gallons per
      second at <m>t=30</m>, so the range is <m>-300 \leq r(t) \leq 600</m>.
      In interval notation we express the range as <m>\lbrack -300, 600 \rbrack</m> .

      <solution><alert> SOLUTION </alert>
      
      
      
      
      a) The slope is <m>m = 0.062</m>, which tells us that the glacier area in the park goes down by <m>0.062 \ \mbox{km}^2</m> per year.  Since 1 km = 1,000 m, it follows that  <m>1 \ \mbox{km}^2 = 1,000,000 \ \mbox{m}^2</m>.  Equivalently, the slope tells us that the glacier area in the park goes down by <m>62,000 \ \mbox{m}^2</m> per year.
      
      
      
      
      b) The <m>A</m>-intercept is <m>b = 16.2</m>, which tells us that in the year 2000, the area was <m>16.2 \ \mbox{km}^2</m>.
      
      
      
      
      c) <m>f( 9 )</m> is the amount of area in the park covered by glaciers in 2012 (9 years after 2000).  <m>f(t) = 9</m> signifies how many years after 2000 will the area covered by glaciers be <m>9 \ \mbox{km}^2</m>.
      
      
      
      
      d) We have <m>f( 9 ) = 16.2 - 0.062( 9) = 15.642</m>
      
      
      
      
      e) <m>m = \frac{ \Delta A }{ \Delta t } = -0.062</m>.  Letting <m>\Delta t = 9</m> we have <m>\frac{ \Delta A }{ 9 } = -0.062</m> , and therefore <m>\Delta A = - 0.558</m>.  So about 0.558 <m>\mbox{km}^2</m> disappear in 9 years.
      
      
      
      
      f) We have <m>16.2 - 0.062 t = 9</m>, so that <m>- 0.062 t = -7.2</m>, and finally  <m>t \approx 116.1</m>.

      Since the function is linear, we can choose any two points (from the graph) to find its formula.  We use the form <m>p = b + mh</m> to get the price of an apartment as a function of its height.  We use the two points (10, 190000) and (20, 230000).  We begin by finding the slope
      
      <me>m = \frac{ \Delta p}{\Delta h} = \frac{230000 - 190000}{20 - 10} = 4000</me>
      
      Next, we substitute a point into our equation using our slope of 4000 dollars per meter of height and solve for <m>b</m>, the <m>p</m>-intercept.  We use the point ( 10, 190000):
      <me>190000 = b + 4000 \cdot 10</me>
      so
      <m>150000 = b</m>.
      
      
      
      Therefore, <m>p = f(h) = 150000 + 4000 h</m>.

      Both <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> lie on <m>y = x^2 +2</m> , so their coordinates must satisfy that equation.  Point <m>Q</m> has <m>x</m>-coordinate 2, so <m>y = 2^2 + 2 = 6</m>.  <m>P</m> has <m>y</m>-coordinate 13, so
      <me>\begin{aligned}
       13 \amp = x^2 + 2, \\
       x^2 \amp = 11, \quad\mbox{so} \\
       x \amp = \pm \sqrt{11}.
      \end{aligned}</me>
      Thus <m>x = - \sqrt{11}</m> because we know from the graph that <m>x \lt  0</m>.  Using coordinates of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, we know that
      
      <me>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{13-6}{- \sqrt{11} - 2} = \frac{7}{- \sqrt{11} - 2}.</me>
      
      Since <m>y = 6</m> when <m>x = 2</m>, we have
      <me>y = \left( \frac{7}{- \sqrt{11} - 2} \right) (x-2) + 6.</me></solution>

  		After linear functions,
    	quadratic functions are arguably the next simplest functions in mathematics.
    	A <em>quadratic function</em> <idx><h>quadratic function</h></idx> is one that may be written in the form
    	<me>
      		q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
    	</me>,
    	where <m>a</m>,
    	<m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are real numbers with <m>a \ne 0</m>.  One of the reasons that quadratic functions are especially important is that they model the height of an object falling under the force of gravity.

		While the quadratic formula will always provide any real solutions to <m>q(x) = 0</m>, in practice it is often easier to attempt to factor before using the formula.  For instance, given <m>q(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6</m>, we can find its <m>x</m>-intercepts quickly by factoring.  Since
		<me>
			x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3)

		it follows that <m>(2,0)</m> and <m>(3,0)</m> are the <m>x</m>-intercepts of <m>q</m>.  Note more generally that if we know the <m>x</m>-intercepts <idx><h>quadratic function</h> <h>x-intercepts</h></idx> of a quadratic function are <m>(r,0)</m> and <m>(s,0)</m>, it follows that we can write the quadratic function in the form <m>q(x) = a(x-r)(x-s)</m>.

		Note particularly that due to symmetry, the vertex of a quadratic function lies halfway between its <m>x</m>-intercepts (provided the function has <m>x</m>-intercepts).  In both <xref ref="F-quadratic-vertex-CCU">Figures</xref> and <xref ref="F-quadratic-vertex-CCD"/>, we see how the parabola is symmetric about the vertical line that passes through the vertex.  One way to understand this symmetry can be seen by writing a given quadratic function in a different algebraic form.  
	</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-quadratic-vertex-form">
            <statement>
              <p>
				Consider the quadratic function in standard form given by <m>y = q(x) = 0.25x^2 - x + 3.5</m>.  Determine constants <m>a</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>k</m> so that <m>q(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k</m>, and hence determine the vertex of <m>q</m>.  How does this alternate form of <m>q</m> explain the symmetry in its graph?
			</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
				We first observe that we can write <m>q(x) = 0.25x^2 - x + 3.5</m> in a form closer to <m>q(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k</m> by factoring <m>0.25</m> from the first two terms to get
				<me>
					q(x) = 0.25(x^2 - 4x) + 3.5
				</me>.
				Next, we want to add a constant inside the parentheses to form a perfect square.  Noting that <m>(x-2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4</m>, we need to add <m>4</m>.  Since we are adding <m>4</m> inside the parentheses, the <m>4</m> is being multiplied by <m>0.25</m>, which has the net effect of adding <m>1</m> to the function.  To keep the function as given, we must also subtract <m>1</m>, and thus we have
				<me>
					q(x) = 0.25(x^2 - 4x + 4) + 3.5 - 1
				</me>.
				It follows that 
				<me>
					q(x) = 0.25(x-2)^2 + 2.5
				</me>.
			</p>
              <p>	
				Next, observe that the vertex of <m>q</m> is <m>(2,2.5)</m>.  This holds because <m>(x-2)^2</m> is always greater than or equal to <m>0</m>, and thus its smallest possible value is <m>0</m> when <m>x = 2</m>.  Moreover, when <m>x = 2</m>, <m>q(2) = 2.5</m>.<fn>We can also verify this point is the vertex using standard form.  From <m>q(x) = 0.25x^2 - x + 3.5</m>, we see that <m>a = 0.25</m> and <m>b = -1</m>, so <m>x = -\frac{b}{2a} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2</m>.  In addition, <m>q(2) = 2.5</m>.</fn>  
			</p>
              <p>
				Finally, the form <m>q(x) = 0.25(x-2)^2 + 2.5</m> explains the symmetry of <m>q</m> about the line <m>x = 2</m>.  Consider the two points that lie equidistant from <m>x = 2</m> on the <m>x</m>-axis, <m>z</m> units away:  <m>x = 2-z</m> and <m>x = 2 + z</m>.  Observe that for these values, 
				<sidebyside width="50%"><p>
						<md><mrow>q(2-z) &amp;= 0.25(2-z-2)^2 + 2.5</mrow><mrow>  &amp;= 0.25(-z)^2 + 2.5</mrow><mrow>  &amp;= 0.25z^2 + 2.5</mrow></md>
					</p><p>
						<md><mrow>q(2+z) &amp;= 0.25(2+z-2)^2 + 2.5</mrow><mrow>  &amp;= 0.25(z)^2 + 2.5</mrow><mrow>  &amp;= 0.25z^2 + 2.5</mrow></md>
					</p></sidebyside>
				Since <m>q(2-z) = q(2+z)</m> for any choice of <m>z</m>, this shows the parabola is symmetric about the vertical line through its vertex.

  		Modeling falling objects
  	</title>
          <p>
	    One of the reasons that quadratic functions are so important is because of a physical fact of the universe we inhabit:
	    for an object only being influenced by gravity, <idx><h>gravity</h></idx>
	    <em>acceleration due to gravity is constant</em>.
	    If we measure time in seconds and a rising or falling object's height in feet,
	    the gravitational constant is <m>g = -32</m> feet per second per second.
	  </p>
          <p>
	    One of the fantastic consequences of calculus <mdash/> which,
	    like the realization that acceleration due to gravity is constant,
	    is largely due to Sir Isaac Newton in the late 1600s <mdash/> is that the height of a falling object at time <m>t</m> is modeled by a quadratic function.

	  	<p>
	  	For an object tossed vertically from an initial height of <m>s_0</m> feet with a velocity of <m>v_0</m> feet per second,

		In <xref ref="T-PA-changing-quadratic-AVs-complete">Table</xref>, we see an interesting pattern in the average velocities of the ball.  Indeed, if we remove the <q><m>AV</m></q> notation and focus on the starting value of each interval, viewing the resulting average rate of change, <m>r</m>, as a function of the starting value, we may consider the related table seen in <xref ref="T-quadratic-linear">Table</xref>, where it is apparent that <m>r</m> is a linear function of <m>a</m>.

		Indeed, viewing this data graphically as in <xref ref="F-quadratic-linear">Figure</xref>, we observe that the average rate of change of <m>h</m> is itself changing in a way that seems to be represented by a linear function.  While it takes key ideas from calculus to formalize this observation, for now we will simply note that for a quadratic function there seems to be a related linear function that tells us something about how the quadratic function changes.  Moreover, we can also say that on the downward-opening quadratic function <m>h</m> that its average rate of change appears to be decreasing as we move from left to right<fn>Provided that we consider the average rate of change on intervals of the same length.  Again, it takes ideas from calculus to make this observation completely precise.</fn>.
	</p>
          <p>
		A key closing observation here is that the fact the parabola <q>bends down</q> is apparently connected to the fact that its average rate of change decreases as we move left to right.  By contrast, for a quadratic function that <q>bends up</q>, we can show that its average rate of change increases as we move left to right (see <xref ref="ez-quadratic-aroc-patterns">Exercise</xref>).  Moreover, we also see that it's possible to view the average rate of change of a function on <m>1</m>-unit intervals as <em>itself</em> being a function: a process that relates an input (the starting value of the interval) to a corresponding output (the average rate of change of the original function on the resulting <m>1</m>-unit interval).  
	</p>
          <p>
		For any function that consistently bends either exclusively upward or exclusively downward on a given interval <m>(a,b)</m>, we use the following formal language<fn>Calculus is needed to make <xref ref="def-quadratic-concave">Definition</xref> rigorous and precise.</fn> to describe it.
	</p>
          <definition xml:id="def-quadratic-concave">
            <idx>
              <h>function trends</h>
              <h>concave up</h>
            </idx>
            <idx>
              <h>function trends</h>
              <h>concave down</h>
            </idx>
            <statement>
              <p>
				If a function <m>f</m> always bends upward on an interval <m>(a,b)</m>, we say that <m>f</m> is <term>concave up on <m>(a,b)</m></term>.  Similarly, if <m>f</m> always bends downward on an interval <m>(a,b)</m>, we say that <m>f</m> is <term>concave down on <m>(a,b)</m></term>.
			</p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
		Thus, we now call a quadratic function <m>q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</m> with <m>a \gt 0</m> <q>concave up</q>, while if <m>a \lt 0</m> we say <m>q</m> is <q>concave down</q>.

          <title>Summary</title>
          <ul>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				Quadratic functions (of the form <m>q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</m> with <m>a \ne 0</m>) are emphatically not linear:  their average rate of change is not constant, but rather depends on the interval chosen.  At the same time, quadratic functions appear to change in a very regimented way:  if we compute the average rate of change on several consecutive <m>1</m>-unit intervals, it appears that the average rate of change itself changes at a constant rate.  Quadratic functions either bend upward (<m>a \gt 0</m>) or bend downward (<m>a \lt 0</m>) and these shapes are connected to whether the average rate of change on consecutive <m>1</m>-unit intervals decreases or increases as we move left to right.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				For an object with height <m>h</m> measured in feet at time <m>t</m> in seconds, if the object was launched vertically at an initial velocity of <m>v_0</m> feet per second and from an initial height of <m>s_0</m> feet, the object's height is given by
  				<me>
  					h = q(t) = -16t^2 + v_0t + s_0
  				</me>.
  				That is, the object's height is completely determined by the initial height and initial velocity from which it was launched.  The model is valid for the entire time until the object lands.  If <m>h</m> is instead measured in meters and <m>v_0</m> in meters per second, <m>-16</m> is replaced with <m>-4.9</m>.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				A quadratic function <m>q</m> can be written in one of three familiar forms:  standard, vertex, or factored<fn>It's not always possible to write a quadratic function in factored form involving only real numbers; this can only be done if it has <m>1</m> or <m>2</m> <m>x</m>-intercepts.</fn>.  <xref ref="T-quadratic-summary-quad-props">Table</xref> shows how, depending on the algebraic form of the function, various properties may be (easily) read from the formula.  In every case, the sign of <m>a</m> determines whether the function opens up or opens down.

      To find the zeros, we solve the equation <m>0 = x^2 - 15 x + 50</m> . We see that this is factorable, as <m>y = (x - 10)(x - 5)</m>.

        <introduction>
          <p>
		Recall that a function, by definition, is a process that takes a collection of inputs and produces a corresponding collection of outputs in such a way that the process produces one and only one output value for any single input value.  Because every function is a process, it makes sense to think that it may be possible to take two function processes and do one of the processes first, and then apply the second process to the result.
	</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-composite-introduction">
            <statement>
              <p>
				Suppose we know that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m> according to the process defined by <m>y = f(x) = x^2 - 1</m> and, in turn, <m>x</m> is a function of <m>t</m> via <m>x = g(t) = 3t-4</m>.  Is it possible to combine these processes to generate a new function so that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>t</m>?
			</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
				Since <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m> and <m>x</m> depends on <m>t</m>, it follows that we can also think of <m>y</m> depending directly on <m>t</m>.  We can use substitution and the notation of functions to determine this relationship.
			</p>
              <p>
				First, it's important to realize what the rule for <m>f</m> tells us.  In words, <m>f</m> says <q>to generate the output that corresponds to an input, take the input and square it, and then subtract <m>1</m>.</q>  In symbols, we might express <m>f</m> more generally by writing <q><m>f(\Box) = \Box^2 - 1</m>.</q>
			</p>
              <p>
				Now, observing that <m>y = f(x) = x^2 - 1</m> and that <m>x = g(t) = 3t - 4</m>, we can substitute the expression <m>g(t)</m> for <m>x</m> in <m>f</m>.  Doing so,
				<md><mrow>y &amp;= f(x)</mrow><mrow>  &amp;= f(g(t))</mrow><mrow>  &amp;= f(3t-4)</mrow></md>.
				Applying the process defined by the function <m>f</m> to the input <m>3t-4</m>, we see that
				<me>
					y = (3t-4)^2 - 1
				</me>,
				which defines <m>y</m> as a function of <m>t</m>.
			</p>
            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
		When we have a situation such as in <xref ref="ex-composite-introduction">Example</xref> where we use the output of one function as the input of another, we often say that we have <q>composed two functions</q>.  In addition, we use the notation <m>h(t) = f(g(t))</m> to denote that a new function, <m>h</m>, results from composing the two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.

          <title>Composing two functions</title>
          <p>
  		Whenever we have two functions, say <m>g : A \to B</m> and <m>f : B \to C</m>, where the codomain of <m>g</m> matches the domain of <m>f</m>, it is possible to link the two processes together to create a new process that we call the <em>composition</em> of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
  	</p>
          <definition xml:id="D-composite-compose-functions">
            <idx>composite function</idx>
            <statement>
              <p>
  				If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are functions such that <m>g : A \to B</m> and <m>f : B \to C</m>, we define the <term>composition of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m></term> to be the new function <m>h: A \to C</m> given by 
  				<me>
  					h(t) = f(g(t))
  				</me>.
  				We also sometimes use the notation <m>h = f \circ g</m>, where <m>f \circ g</m> is the single function defined by <m>(f \circ g)(t) = f(g(t))</m>.
  			</p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
  		We sometimes call <m>g</m> the <q>inner function</q> and <m>f</m> the <q>outer function</q>.  It is important to note that the inner function is actually the first function that gets applied to a given input, and then outer function is applied to the output of the inner function.  In addition, in order for a composite function to make sense, we need to ensure that the range of the inner function lies within the domain of the outer function so that the resulting composite function is defined at every possible input.
  	</p>
          <p>
	    In addition to the possibility that functions are given by formulas,
	    functions can be given by tables or graphs.
	    We can think about composite functions in these settings as well,
	    and the following activities prompt us to consider functions given in this way.

		Recall Dolbear's function, <m>T = D(N) = 40 + 0.25N</m>, that relates the number of chirps per minute from a snowy cricket to the Fahrenheit temperature, <m>T</m>.  We earlier established that <m>D</m> has a domain of <m>[40,160]</m> and a corresponding range of <m>[50,85]</m>.  In what follows, we replace <m>T</m> with <m>F</m> to emphasize that temperature is measured in Fahrenheit degrees.
	</p>
          <p>
		The Celcius and Fahrenheit temperature scales are connected by a linear function.  Indeed, the function that converts Fahrenheit to Celcius is
        <me>
        	C = G(F) = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)
        </me>.
        For instance, a Fahrenheit temperature of <m>32</m> degrees corresponds to <m>C = G(32) = 0</m> degrees Celcius.

In the study of calculus, we progress from the <em>average rate of change on an interval</em> to the <em>instantaneous rate of change of a function at a single value</em>; the core idea that allows us to move from an <em>average</em> rate to an <em>instantaneous</em> one is letting the interval <m>[a,b]</m> shrink in size.

	    To think about the interval <m>[a,b]</m> shrinking while <m>a</m> stays fixed, we often change our perspective and think of <m>b</m> as <m>b = a + h</m>, where <m>h</m> measures the horizontal differene from <m>b</m> to <m>a</m>.  This allows us to eventually think about <m>h</m> getting closer and closer to <m>0</m>, and in that context we consider the equivalent expression

	    In this most recent expression for <m>AV_{[a,a+h]}</m>,
	    we see the important role that the composite function

		In <xref ref="act-changing-composite-aroc">Activity</xref>, we see an important setting where algebraic simplification plays a crucial role in calculus.  Because the expresssion 
		<me>
	      AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} 
	    </me>
	    always begins with an <m>h</m> in the denominator, in order to precisely understand how this quantity behaves when <m>h</m> gets close to <m>0</m>, a simplified version of this expression is needed.  For instance, as we found in part (b) of <xref ref="act-changing-composite-aroc">Activity</xref>, it's possible to show that for <m>f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1</m>,
	    <me>
	    	AV_{[1,1+h]} = 2h + 1
	    </me>,
	    which is a much simpler expression to investigate.

          <ul>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				When defined, the composition of two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> produces a single new function <m>f \circ g</m> according to the rule <m>(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))</m>.  We note that <m>g</m> is applied first to the input <m>x</m>, and then <m>f</m> is applied to the output <m>g(x)</m> that results from <m>g</m>.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				In the composite function <m>h(x) = f(g(x))</m>, the <q>inner</q> function is <m>g</m> and the <q>outer</q> function is <m>f</m>.  Note that the inner function gets applied to <m>x</m> first, even though the outer function appears first when we read from left to right.  The composite function is only defined provided that the codomain of <m>g</m> matches the domain of <m>f</m>: that is, we need any possible outputs of <m>g</m> to be among the allowed inputs for <m>f</m>.  In particular, we can say that if <m>g : A \to B</m> and <m>f : B \to C</m>, then <m>f \circ g : A \to C</m>.  Thus, the domain of the composite function is the domain of the inner function, and the codomain of the composite function is the codomain of the outer function.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				Because the expression <m>AV_{[a,a+h]}</m> is defined by
  				<me>
	      			AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} 
	    		</me>
	    		and this includes the quantity <m>f(a+h)</m>, the average rate of change of a function on the interval <m>[a,a+h]</m> always involves the evaluation of a composite function expression.  This idea plays a crucial role in the study of calculus.

            <statement>
              <p>
        A spherical tank has radius <m>4</m> feet.  The tank is initially empty and then begins to be filled in such a way that the height of the water rises at a constant rate of <m>0.4</m> feet per minute.  Let <m>V</m> be the volume of water in the tank at a given instant, and <m>h</m> the depth of the water at the same instant; let <m>t</m> denote the time elapsed in minutes since the tank started being filled.

        <ol label="a."><li>
            <p>
              Calculus can be used to show that the volume, <m>V</m>, is a function of the depth, <m>h</m>, of the water in the tank according to the function

              We are given the fact that the tank is being filled in such a way that the height of the water rises at a constant rate of <m>0.4</m> feet per minute.  Said differently, <m>h</m> is a function of <m>t</m> whose average rate of change is constant.  What kind of function does this make <m>h = p(t)</m>?  Determine a formula for <m>p(t)</m>.

            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              In (a) we observed that <m>V</m> is a function of <m>h</m>, and in (b) we found that <m>h</m> is a function of <m>t</m>.  Use these two facts and function composition appropriately to write <m>V</m> as a function of <m>t</m>.  Call the resulting function <m>V = q(t)</m>.

            <p>
              On the provided axes, sketch accurate graphs of <m>h = p(t)</m> and <m>V = q(t)</m>, labeling the vertical and horizontal scale on each graph appropriately.  Make your graphs as precise as you can; use a computing device to assist as needed.

		Because every function is a process that converts a collection of inputs to a corresponding collection of outputs, a natural question is: for a particular function, can we change perspective and think of the original function's outputs as the inputs for a reverse process?
		If we phrase this question algebraically, it is analogous to asking: given an equation that defines <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>, is it possible to find a corresponding equation where <m>x</m> is a function of <m>y</m>?

          <title>When a function has an inverse function</title>
          <p>
  		In <xref ref="PA-changing-inverse-F-C">Preview Activity</xref>, we found that for the function <m>F = g(C) = \frac{9}{5}C + 32</m>, it's also possible to solve for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>F</m> and write <m>C = h(F) = \frac{5}{9}(C-32)</m>.  The first function, <m>g</m>, converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit ones; the second function, <m>h</m>, converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius ones.  Thus, the process <m>h</m> reverses the process of <m>g</m>, and likewise the process of <m>g</m> reverses the process of <m>h</m>.  This is also why it makes sense that <m>h(g(C)) = C</m> and <m>g(h(F)) = F</m>.  If, for instance, we take a Celsius temperature <m>C</m>, convert it to Fahrenheit, and convert the result back to Celsius, we arrive back at the Celsius temperature we started with:  <m>h(g(C)) = C</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		Similar work is sometimes possible with other functions.  When we can find a new function that reverses the process of the original function, we say that the original function <q>has an inverse function</q> and make the following formal definition.

  				for each <m>a</m> in <m>A</m> and each <m>b</m> in <m>B</m>, then we say that <m>f</m> has an <term>inverse function</term> and that the function <m>g</m> is <term>the inverse of <m>f</m></term>.

		When a given function has an inverse function, it allows us to express the same relationship from two different points of view.  For instance, if <m>y = f(t) = 2t+1</m>, we can show<fn>Observe that <m>g(f(t)) = g(2t+1) = \frac{(2t+1)-1}{2} = \frac{2t}{2} = t</m>.  Similarly, <m>f(g(y)) = f\left(\frac{y-1}{2}\right) = 2\left(\frac{y-1}{2} \right) + 1 = y-1 + 1 = y</m>.</fn> that the function <m>t = g(y) = \frac{y-1}{2}</m> reverses the effect of <m>f</m> (and vice versa), and thus <m>g = f^{-1}</m>.  We observe that 
		<me>
			y = f(t) = 2t + 1 \text{ and } t = f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y-1}{2}
		</me>
		are equivalent forms of the same equation, and thus they say the same thing from two different perspectives.  The first version of the equation is solved for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>t</m>, while the second equation is solved for <m>t</m> in terms of <m>y</m>.  This important principle holds in general whenever a function has an inverse function.

              <p>
				For any function, the question of whether or not it has an inverse comes down to whether or not the process of the function can be reliably reversed.  For functions given in table form such as <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, we essentially ask if it's possible to swich the input and output rows and have the new resulting table also represent a function.
			</p>
              <p>
				The function <m>f</m> does not have an inverse function because there are two different inputs that lead to the same output:  <m>f(0) = 6</m> and <m>f(4) = 6</m>.  If we attempt to reverse this process, we have a situation where the input <m>6</m> would correspond to <em>two</em> potential outputs, <m>4</m> and <m>6</m>.
			</p>
              <p>
				However, the function <m>g</m> does have an inverse function because when we reverse the rows in <xref ref="T-inverse-does-it-2">Table</xref>, each input (in order, <m>3</m>, <m>1</m>, <m>4</m>, <m>2</m>, <m>0</m>) indeed corresponds to one and only one output (in order, <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, <m>3</m>, <m>4</m>).  We can thus make observations such as <m>g^{-1}(4) = 2</m>, which is the same as saying that <m>g(2) = 4</m>, just from a different perspective.

				Recall that when a point such as <m>(a,c)</m> lies on the graph of a function <m>p</m>, this means that the input <m>x = a</m>, which represents to a value on the horizontal axis, corresponds with the output <m>y = c</m> that is represented by a value on the vertical axis.  In this situation, we write <m>p(a) = c</m>.  We note explicitly that <m>p</m> is a function because its graph passes the <xref ref="asm-functions-V-L-test" text="title"/>: any vertical line intersects the graph of <m>p</m> exactly, and thus each input from the domain corresponds to one and only one output.
			</p>
              <p>
				If we attempt to change perspective and use the graph of <m>p</m> to view <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>, we see that this fails because the output value <m>c</m> is associated with two different inputs, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.  Said differently, because the horizontal line <m>y = c</m> intersects the graph of <m>p</m> at both <m>(a,c)</m> and <m>(b,c)</m> (as shown in <xref ref="F-inverse-does-it-1">Figure</xref>), we cannot view <m>y</m> as the input to a function process that produces the corresonding <m>x</m>-value.  Therefore, <m>p</m> does not have an inverse function.
			</p>
              <p>
				On the other hand, provided that the behavior seen in the figure continues, the function <m>q</m> does have an inverse because we can view <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m> via the graph given in <xref ref="F-inverse-does-it-2">Figure</xref>.  This is because for any choice of <m>y</m>, there corresponds one and only one <m>x</m> that results from <m>y</m>.  We can think of this visually by starting at a value such as <m>y = c</m> on the <m>y</m>-axis, moving horizontally to where the line intersects the graph of <m>p</m>, and then moving down to the corresonding location (here <m>x = a</m>) on the horizontal axis.  From the behavior of the graph of <m>q</m> (a straight line that is always increasing), we see that this correspondence will hold for any choice of <m>y</m>, and thus indeed <m>x</m> is a function of <m>y</m>.  From this, we can say that <m>q</m> indeed has an inverse function.  We thus can write that <m>q^{-1}(c) = a</m>, which is a different way to express the equivalent fact that <m>q(a) = c</m>.

              <p>
				For any function of the form <m>y = f(t)</m>, one way to determine if we can view the original input variable <m>t</m> as a function of the original output variable <m>y</m> is to attempt to solve the equation <m>y = f(t)</m> for <m>t</m> in terms of <m>y</m>.
			</p>
              <p>
				Taking <m>y = 3 - \frac{1}{5}(t-1)^3</m>, we try to solve for <m>t</m> by first subtracting <m>3</m> from both sides to get 
				<me>
					y - 3 = -\frac{1}{5}(t-1)^3
				</me>.
				Next, multiplying both sides by <m>-5</m>, it follows that
				<me>
					(t-1)^3 = -5(y-3)
				</me>.
				Because the cube root function has the property that <m>\sqrt[3]{z^3} = z</m> for every real number <m>z</m> (since the cube root function is the inverse function for the cubing function, and each function has both a domain and range of all real numbers), we can take the cube root of both sides of the preceding equation to get
				<me>
					t - 1 = \sqrt[3]{-5(y-3)}
				</me>.
				Finally, adding <m>1</m> to both sides, we have determined that
				<me>
					t = 1 + \sqrt[3]{-5(y-3)}
				</me>.
				Because we have been able to express <m>t</m> as a single function of <m>y</m> for every possible value of <m>y</m>, this shows that <m>r</m> indeed has an inverse and that <m>t = r^{-1}(y) = 1 + \sqrt[3]{-5(y-3)}</m>.
			</p>
              <p>
				We attempt similar reasoning for the second function, <m>y = 3 - \frac{1}{5}(t-1)^2</m>.  To solve for <m>t</m>, we first subtract <m>3</m> from both sides, so that
				<me>
					y - 3 = -\frac{1}{5}(t-1)^2
				</me>.
				After multiplying both sides by <m>-5</m>, we have 
				<me>
					(t-1)^2 = -5(y-3)
				</me>.
				Next, it's necessary to take the square root of both sides in an effort to isolate <m>t</m>.  Here, however, we encounter a crucial issue.  Because the function <m>g(x) = x^2</m> takes any nonzero number and its opposite to the same output (e.g. <m>(-5)^2 = 25 = (5)^2</m>), this means that we have to account for <em>both</em> possible inputs that result in the same output.  Based on our last equation, this means that either
				<me>
					t-1 = \sqrt{-5(y-3)} \ \text{ or } \ t-1 = -\sqrt{-5(y-3)}
				</me>.
				As such, we find not a single equation that expresses <m>t</m> as a function of <m>y</m>, but rather two:
				<me>
					t = 1 + \sqrt{-5(y-3)} \ \text{ or } \ t = 1 -\sqrt{-5(y-3)}
				</me>.
				Since it appears that <m>t</m> can't be expressed as a single function of <m>y</m>, it seems to follow that <m>y = s(t) = 3 - \frac{1}{5}(t-1)^2</m> does not have an inverse function.

  		When a function has an inverse function, we have observed several important relationships that hold between the original function and the corresponding inverse function.

  			Let <m>f  : A \to B</m> be a function whose domain is <m>A</m> and whose range is <m>B</m> be such that <m>f</m> has an inverse function, <m>f^{-1}</m>.  Then:

  		<p>
  			<ul><li>

  				</li><li>
					<p>
						The functions <m>f</m> and <m>f^{-1}</m> reverse one anothers' processes.  Symbolically, 
						<m>f^{-1}(f(a)) = a</m> for every input <m>a</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>, and similarly, 
						<m>f(f^{-1}(b)) = b</m> for every input <m>b</m> in the domain of <m>f^{-1}</m>.

					<p>
						Consider the setting where <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are collections of real numbers. If a point <m>(x,y)</m> lies on the graph of <m>f</m>, then it follows <m>y = f(x)</m>.  From this, we can equivalently say that <m>x = f^{-1}(y)</m>.  Hence, the point <m>(y,x)</m> lies on the graph of <m>x = f^{-1}(y)</m>.

  		The last item above leads to a special relationship between the graphs of <m>f</m> and <m>f^{-1}</m> when viewed on the same coordinate axes.  In that setting, we need to view <m>x</m> as the input of each function (since it's the horizontal coordinate) and <m>y</m> as the output.  If we know a particular input-output relationship for <m>f</m>, say <m>f(-1) = \frac{1}{2}</m>, then it follows that <m>f^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = -1</m>.  We observe that the points <m>\left(-1, \frac{1}{2} \right)</m> and <m>\left(\frac{1}{2}, -1 \right)</m> are reflections of each other across the line <m>y = x</m>.  Because such a relationship holds for every point <m>(x,y)</m> on the graph of <m>f</m>, this means that the graphs of <m>f</m> and <m>f^{-1}</m> are reflections of one another across the line <m>y = x</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-inverse-plot-reflection">Figure</xref>.

If we have a formula for the function <m>f</m>, say <m>y = f(t)</m>, we know <m>f</m> has an inverse function if we can solve for <m>t</m> and write <m>t = f^{-1}(y)</m>.

      (a) The perimeter of a square of side length <m>s</m> is <m>P = f(s) = 4s</m>.
      
      
      
      
      
      (b) Thus, <m>f(4) = 16</m>, which is
      the perimeter of a square of side length 4.
      
      
      
      
      
      (c) The inverse function <m>s = f^{-1}(P) = P/4</m>, so
      <m>f^{-1}(32) = 8</m>, which is the side length of a square
      of perimeter 32.
      
      
      
      
      
      (d) The inverse function is obtained by solving <m>P = f(s) = 4s</m>
      for <m>s = f^{-1}(P) = P/4</m>.

        <introduction>
          <p>
  		In our preparation for calculus, we aspire to understand functions from a wide range of perspectives and to become familiar with a library of basic functions.  So far, two basic families functions we have considered are linear functions and quadratic functions, the simplest of which are <m>L(x) = x</m> and <m>Q(x) = x^2</m>.  As we progress further, we will endeavor to understand a <q>parent</q> function  as the most fundamental member of a family of functions, as well as how other similar but more complicated functions are the result of transforming the parent function.  
  	</p>
          <p>
		Informally, a transformation <idx><h>transformation of a function</h></idx> of a given function is an algebraic process by which we change the function to a related function that has the same fundamental shape, but may be shifted, reflected, and/or stretched in a systematic way.  For example, among all quadratic functions, the simplest is the parent function <m>Q(x) = x^2</m>, but any other quadratic function such as <m>g(x) = -3(x-5)^2 + 4</m> can also be understood in relation to the parent function.  We say that <q><m>g</m> is a transformation of <m>f</m>.</q>
	</p>
          <p>	
  		In <xref ref="PA-changing-transformations-quadratic">Preview Activity</xref>, we investigate the effects of the constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> in generating the function <m>g(x) = af(x-b) + c</m> in the context of already knowing the function <m>f</m>.

In <xref ref="F-transformations-vert">Figure</xref>, we see the original parent function <m>f(x) = |x|</m> along with the resulting transformation <m>g(x) = f(x)-3</m>, which is a downward vertical shift of <m>3</m> units.  Note particularly that every point on the original graph of <m>f</m> is moved <m>3</m> units down; we often indicate this by an arrow and labeling at least one key point on each graph.

		In <xref ref="F-transformations-horiz">Figure</xref>, we see a horizontal translation of the original function <m>f</m> that shifts its graph <m>2</m> units to the right to form the function <m>h</m>.  Observe that <m>f</m> is not a familiar basic function; transformations may be applied to any original function we desire.	
	</p>
          <p>
		From an algebraic point of view, horizontal translations are slightly more complicated than vertical ones.  Given <m>y = f(x)</m>, if we define the transformed function <m>y = h(x) = f(x-b)</m>, observe that
		<me>
			h(x+b) = f( (x+b) - b ) = f(x)
		</me>.
		This shows that for an input of <m>x+b</m> in <m>h</m>, the output of <m>h</m> is the same as the output of <m>f</m> that corresponds to an input of simply <m>x</m>.  Hence, in <xref ref="F-transformations-horiz">Figure</xref>, the formula for <m>h</m> in terms of <m>f</m> is <m>h(x) = f(x-2)</m>, since an input of <m>x+2</m> in <m>h</m> will result in the same output as an input of <m>x</m> in <m>f</m>.    For example, <m>h(2) = f(0)</m>, which aligns with the graph of <m>h</m> being a shift of the graph of <m>f</m> to the right by <m>2</m> units.
	</p>
          <p>
		Again, it's instructive to see the effects of horizontal translation dynamically.

          <title>Vertical stretches and reflections</title>
          <p>
  		So far, we have seen the possible effects of adding a constant value to function output <dash><m>f(x)+a</m></dash> and adding a constant value to function input <dash/> <m>f(x+b)</m>.  Each of these actions results in a translation of the function's graph (either vertically or horizontally), but otherwise leaving the graph the same.  Next, we investigate the effects of multiplication the function's output by a constant.

  				Given the parent function <m>y = f(x)</m> pictured in <xref ref="F-transformations-vert-stretch-1">Figure</xref>, what are the effects of the transformation <m>y = v(x) = cf(x)</m> for various values of <m>c</m>?

              <p>
				We first investigate the effects of <m>c = 2</m> and <m>c = \frac{1}{2}</m>.  For <m>v(x) = 2f(x)</m>, the algebraic impact of this transformation is that every output of <m>f</m> is multiplied by <m>2</m>.  This means that the only output that is unchanged is when <m>f(x) = 0</m>, while any other point on the graph of the original function <m>f</m> will be stretched vertically away from the <m>x</m>-axis by a factor of <m>2</m>.  We can see this in <xref ref="F-transformations-vert-stretch-1">Figure</xref> where each point on the original dark blue graph is transformed to a corresponding point whose <m>y</m>-coordinate is twice as large, as partially indicated by the red arrows.

              <p>
				In contrast, the transformation <m>u(x) = \frac{1}{2}f(x)</m> is stretched vertically by a factor of <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, which has the effect of compressing the graph of <m>f</m> towards the <m>x</m>-axis, as all function outputs of <m>f</m> are multiplied by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.  For instance, the point <m>(0,-2)</m> on the graph of <m>f</m> is transformed to the graph of <m>(0,-1)</m> on the graph of <m>u</m>, and others are transformed as indicated by the purple arrows.
			</p>
              <p>
				To consider the situation where <m>c \lt 0</m>, we first consider the simplest case where <m>c = -1</m> in the transformation <m>z(x) = -f(x)</m>.  Here the impact of the transformation is to multiply every output of the parent function <m>f</m> by <m>-1</m>; this takes any point of form <m>(x,y)</m> and transforms it to <m>(x,-y)</m>, which means we are reflecting each point on the original function's graph across the <m>x</m>-axis to generate the resulting function's graph.  This is demonstrated in <xref ref="F-transformations-vert-stretch-2">Figure</xref> where <m>y = z(x)</m> is the reflection of <m>y = f(x)</m> across the <m>x</m>-axis.
			</p>
              <p>
				Finally, we also investigate the case where <m>c = -2</m>, which generates <m>y = w(x) = -2f(x)</m>.  Here we can think of <m>-2</m> as <m>-2 = 2(-1)</m>: the effect of multiplying by <m>-1</m> first reflects the graph of <m>f</m> across the <m>x</m>-axis (resulting in <m>w</m>), and then multiplying by <m>2</m> stretches the graph of <m>z</m> vertically to result in <m>w</m>, as shown in <xref ref="F-transformations-vert-stretch-2">Figure</xref>.

          <p>
		In the final question of <xref ref="act-changing-transformations-vert-stretch">Activity</xref>, we considered the transformation <m>y = m(x) = 2r(x+1)-1</m> of the original function <m>r</m>.  There are three different basic transformations involved: a vertical shift of <m>1</m> unit down, a horizontal shift of <m>1</m> unit left, and a vertical stretch by a factor of <m>2</m>.  To understand the order in which these transformations are applied, it's essential to remember that a function is a <em>process</em> that converts inputs to outputs.
	</p>
          <p>
		By the algebraic rule for <m>m</m>, <m>m(x) = 2r(x+1)-1</m>.  In words, this means that given an input <m>x</m> for <m>m</m>, we do the following processes in this particular order:

		<ol><li>

		These three steps correspond to three basic transformations:  (1) shift the graph of <m>r</m> to the left by <m>1</m> unit; (2) stretch the resulting graph vertically by a factor of <m>2</m>; (3) shift the resulting graph vertically by <m>-1</m> units.  We can see the graphical impact of these algebraic steps by taking them one at a time.  In <xref ref="F-transformations-combined-order-2">Figure</xref>, we see the function <m>p</m> that results from a shift <m>1</m> unit left of the parent function in <xref ref="F-transformations-combined-order-1">Figure</xref>.  (Each time we take an additional step, we will de-emphasize the preceding function by having it appear in lighter color and dashed.)

          <p>
		Continuing, we now consider the function <m>q(x) = 2p(x) = 2r(x+1)</m>, which results in a vertical stretch of <m>p</m> away from the <m>x</m>-axis by a factor of <m>2</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-transformations-combined-order-3">Figure</xref>.

            </figure>
          </sidebyside>
          <p>
		Finally, we arrive at <m>y = m(x) = 2r(x+1) - 1</m> by subtracting <m>1</m> from <m>q(x) = 2r(x+1)</m>; this of course is a vertical shift of <m>-1</m> units, and produces the graph of <m>m</m> shown in red in <xref ref="F-transformations-combined-order-4">Figure</xref>.  We can also track the point <m>(2,-1)</m> on the original parent function:  it first moves left <m>1</m> unit to <m>(1,-1)</m>, then it is stretched vertically by a factor of <m>2</m> away from the <m>x</m>-axis to <m>(1,-2)</m>, and lastly is shifted <m>1</m> unit down to the point <m>(1,-3)</m>, which we see on the graph of <m>m</m>.
	</p>
          <p>
		While there are some transformations that can be executed in either order (such as a combination of a horizontal translation and a vertical translation, as seen in part (b) of <xref ref="act-changing-transformations-translations">Activity</xref>), in other situations order matters.  For instance, in our preceding discussion, we have to apply the vertical stretch <em>before</em> applying the vertical shift.  Algebraically, this is because 
		<me>
			2r(x+1) - 1 \ne 2[r(x+1)-1]
		</me>.
		The quantity <m>2r(x+1) - 1</m> multiplies the function <m>r(x+1)</m> by <m>2</m> first (the stretch) and then the vertical shift follows; the quantity <m>2[r(x+1) - 1]</m> shifts the function <m>r(x+1)</m> down <m>1</m> unit first, and then executes a vertical stretch by a factor of <m>2</m>.  In the latter scenario, the point <m>(1,-1)</m> that lies on <m>r(x+1)</m> gets transformed first to <m>(1,-2)</m> and then to <m>(1,-4)</m>, which is not the same as the point <m>(1,-3)</m> that lies on <m>m(x) = 2r(x+1) - 1</m>.

  				<p>
  					The graph of <m>y = g(x) = af(x-b) + c</m> is related to the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> by a sequence of transformations.  First, there is horizontal shift of <m>|b|</m> units to the right (<m>b \gt 0</m>) or left (<m>b \lt 0</m>).  Next, there is a vertical stretch by a factor of <m>|a|</m> (along with a reflection across <m>y = 0</m> in the case where <m>a \lt 0</m>).  Finally, there's a vertical shift of <m>c</m> units.
  				</p>
  			</li><li>
  				<p>
  					A transformation of a given function <m>f</m> is a process by which the graph may be shifted or stretched to generate a new, related function with fundamentally the same shape.  In this section we considered four different ways this can occur: through a horizontal translation (shift), through a reflection across the line <m>y = 0</m> (the <m>x</m>-axis), through a vertical scaling (stretch) that multiplies every output of a function by the same constant, and through a vertical translation (shift).  Each of these individual processes is itself a transformation, and they may be combined in various ways to create more complicated transformations.

      (a) The translation <m>f(x-6)</m> moves the graph to the right 6 units.
      The <m>y</m>-coordinate is not changed, but the <m>x</m>-coordinate is
      <m>9 + 6 = 15</m>, and the new point is therefore (15, 4).
      
      
      
      (b) The translation <m>f(x)-5</m> moves the graph down 5 units. The
      <m>x</m>-coordinate is not changed, but the <m>y</m>-coordinate is
      <m>4 - 5 = -1</m>, and the new point is therefore (9, -1).
      
      
      
      (c) The translation <m>f(x+2) + 7</m> moves the graph both to the
      left 2 units and up 7 units.  Both coordinates will therefore
      change. The <m>x</m>-coordinate is <m>9 - 2 = 7</m>, the
      <m>y</m>-coordinate is <m>4 + 7 = 11</m>, and the new
      point is therefore (7, 11).

  					How can we create new functions by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing given functions?

        <introduction>
          <p>
		In arithmetic, we execute processes where we take two numbers to generate a new number.  For example, <m>2 + 3 = 5</m>:  the number <m>5</m> results from adding <m>2</m> and <m>3</m>.  Similarly, we can multiply two numbers to generate a new one:  <m>2 \cdot 3 = 6</m>.
	</p>
          <p>
		We can work similarly with functions.  Indeed, we have already seen a sophisticated way to combine two functions to generate a new, related function through composition.  If <m>g : A \to B</m> and <m>f : B \to C</m>, then we know there's a new, related function <m>f \circ g : A \to C</m> defined by the process <m>(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))</m>.  Said differently, the new function <m>f \circ g</m> results from executing <m>g</m> first, followed by <m>f</m>. 
	</p>
          <p>
		Just as we can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers, we can also add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions to create a new function from two or more given functions.
	</p>

          <title>Arithmetic with functions</title>
          <p>
	    In most mathematics up until calculus,
	    the main object we study is <em>numbers</em>.
	    We ask questions such as
	    <ul><li>
	    		<p>
	    			<q>what number(s) form solutions to the equation <m>x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0</m>?</q>
	    		</p>
	    	</li><li>
	    		<p>
	    			<q>what number is the slope of the line <m>3x - 4y = 7</m>?</q>
	    		</p>
	    	</li><li>
	    		<p>
	    			<q>what number is generated as output by the function
	    			<m>f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}</m> by the input <m>x = -2</m>?</q>
	    		</p>
	    	</li></ul> 
	    Certainly we also study overall patterns as seen in functions and equations,
	    but this usually occurs through an examination of numbers themselves,
	    and we think of numbers as the main objects being acted upon.
	  </p>
          <p>
	    This changes in calculus.  In calculus, the fundamental objects being studied are
	    functions themselves.  A function is a much more sophisticated mathematical object than a number,
	    in part because a function can be thought of in terms of its graph, which is an infinite collection of ordered pairs of the form <m>(x,f(x))</m>.
	  </p>
          <p>
	  	It is often helpful to look at a function's formula and observe algebraic structure.  For instance, given the quadratic function
	  	<me>
	  		q(x) = -3x^2 + 5x - 7
	  	</me>
	  	we might benefit from thinking of this as the sum of three simpler functions:  the constant function <m>c(x) = -7</m>, the linear function <m>s(x) = 5x</m> that passes through <m>(0,0)</m> with slope <m>m = 5</m>, and the concave down basic quadratic function <m>w(x) = -3x^2</m>.  Indeed, each of the simpler functions <m>c</m>, <m>s</m>, and <m>w</m> contribute to making <m>q</m> be the function that it is.  Likewise, if we were interested in the function <m>p(x) = (3x^2 + 4)(9 - 2x^2)</m>, it might be natural to think about the two simpler functions <m>f(x) = 3x^2 + 4</m> and <m>g(x) = 9 - 2x^2</m> that are being multiplied to produce <m>p</m>.
	  </p>
          <p>
	  	We thus naturally arrive at the ideas of adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing two or more functions, and hence introduce the following definitions and notation.

          <p>
	    When we work in applied settings with functions that model phenomena in the world around us,
	    it is often useful to think carefully about the units of various quantities.
	    Analyzing units can help us both understand the algebraic structure of functions and the variables involved,
	    as well as assist us in assigning meaning to quantities we compute.
	    We have already seen this with the notion of average rate of change:
	    if a function <m>P(t)</m> measures the population in a city in year <m>t</m> and we compute <m>AV_{[5, 11]}</m>,
	    then the units on <m>AV_{[5, 11]}</m> are
	    <q>people per year,</q>
	    and the value of <m>AV_{[5, 11]}</m> is telling us the average rate at which the population changes in people per year on the time interval from year <m>5</m> to year <m>11</m>.
  	</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-combining-stock-value">
            <statement>

		      Let <m>N(t)</m> represent the number of shares owned on day <m>t</m>,
		      where <m>t = 0</m> represents the first day on which shares were purchased.
		      Let <m>S(t)</m> give the value of one share of the stock on day <m>t</m>;

As we can see in <xref ref="F-combining-defn-abs-val">Figure</xref>, for <m>x</m> values less than <m>0</m>, the function <m>y = -x</m> applies, whereas for <m>x</m> greater than or equal to <m>0</m>, the rule is determined by <m>y = x</m>.
	</p>
          <p>
		As long as we are careful to make sure that each potential input has one and only one corresponding output, we can define a piecewise function using as many different functions on different intervals as we desire.

          <p>
  		<ul><li>
  				<p>
  					Just as we can generate a new number by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing two given numbers, we can generate a new function by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing two given functions.  For instance, if we know formulas, graphs, or tables for functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> that share the same domain, we can create their product <m>p</m> according to the rule <m>p(x) = (f \cdot g)(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)</m>. 
  				</p>
  			</li><li>
  				<p>
  					A piecewise function is a function whose formula consists of at least two different formulas in such a way that which formula applies depends on where the input falls in the domain.  For example, given two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> each defined on all real numbers, we can define a new piecewise function <m>P</m> according to the rule
  					<me>
  						P(x) = 
	        			\begin{cases}
	        				f(x), \amp  x \lt  a \\
	        				g(x), \amp x \ge a
	        			\end{cases}
  					</me>
  					This tells us that for any <m>x</m> to the left of <m>a</m>, we use the rule for <m>f</m>, whereas for any <m>x</m> to the right of or equal to <m>a</m>, we use the rule for <m>g</m>.  We can use as many different functions as we want on different intervals, provided the intervals don't overlap.

              <p>
        One of the most important principles in the study of changing quantities is found in the relationship between distance,
        average velocity, and time.
        For a moving body traveling on a straight-line path at an average rate of <m>v</m> for a period of time <m>t</m>,
        the distance traveled, <m>d</m>, is given by
        <me>
          d = v \cdot t
        </me>
      </p>
              <p>
          In the Ironman Triathlon,
          competitors swim <m>2.4</m> miles, bike <m>112</m> miles,
          and then run a <m>26.2</m> mile marathon.
          In the following sequence of questions,
          we build a piecewise function that models a competitor's location in the race at a given time <m>t</m>.
          To start, we have the following known information.

          <ul><li>
              <p>
                She swims at an average rate of <m>2.5</m> miles per hour throughout the <m>2.4</m> miles in the water.
              </p>
            </li><li>
              <p>
                Her transition from swim to bike takes <m>3</m> minutes (<m>0.05</m> hours),
                during which time she doesn't travel any additional distance.
              </p>
            </li><li>
              <p>
                She bikes at an average rate of <m>21</m> miles per hour throughout the <m>112</m> miles of biking.
              </p>
            </li><li>
              <p>
                Her transition from bike to run takes just over <m>2</m> minutes (<m>0.03</m> hours),
                during which time she doesn't travel any additional distance.
              </p>
            </li><li>
              <p>
                She runs at an average rate of <m>8.5</m> miles per hour throughout the marathon.
              </p>
            </li><li>
              <p>
                In the questions that follow,
                assume for the purposes of the model that the triathlete swims, bikes,
                and runs at essentially constant rates
                (given by the average rates stated above).
              </p>
            </li></ul>

          <ol label="a."><li>
              <p>
                Determine the time the swimmer exits the water.
                Report your result in hours.
              </p>
            </li><li>
              <p>
                Likewise, determine the time the athlete gets off her bike,
                as well as the time she finishes the race.
              </p>
            </li><li>
              <p>
                List 5 key points in the form (time, distance):
                when exiting the water, when starting the bike,
                when finishing the bike, when starting the run,
                and when finishing the run.
              </p>
            </li><li>
              <p>
                What is the triathlete's average velocity over the course of the entire race?
                Is this velocity the average of her swim velocity, bike velocity, and run velocity?  Why or why not?
              </p>
            </li><li>
              <p>
                Determine a piecewise function <m>s(t)</m> whose value at any given time
                (in hours)
                is the triathlete's total distance traveled.
              </p>
            </li><li>
              <p>
                Sketch a carefully labeled graph of the triathlete's distance traveled as a function of time on the axes provided.
                Provide clear scale and note key points on the graph.

		    Certain naturally occurring phenomena eventually repeat themselves, especially when the phenomenon is somehow connected to a circle.  For example, suppose that you are taking a ride on a ferris wheel and we consider your height, <m>h</m>, above the ground and how your height changes in tandem with the distance, <m>d</m>, that you have traveled around the wheel.  In <xref ref="F-traversing-ferris-wheel-animation">Figure</xref> we see a snapshot of this situation, which is available as a full animation<fn>Used with permission from Illuminations by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.

          <p>
  			Because we have two quantities changing in tandem, it is natural to wonder if it is possible to represent one as a function of the other.

		The natural phenomenon of a point moving around a circle leads to interesting relationships.  For easier arithmetic, let's consider a point traversing a circle of circumference <m>24</m> and examine how the point's height, <m>h</m>, changes as the distance traversed, <m>d</m>, changes.  Note particularly that each time the point traverses <m>\frac{1}{8}</m> of the circumference of the circle, it travels a distance of <m>24 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 3</m> units, as seen in <xref ref="F-traversing-first-example">Figure</xref> where each noted point lies <m>3</m> additional units along the circle beyond the preceding one.
	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-traversing-first-example">
            <caption>A point traversing a circle with circumference <m>C = 24</m>.</caption>
            <image source="images/traversing-first-example" width="45%"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
		Note that we know the exact heights of certain points.  Since the circle has circumference <m>C = 24</m>, we know that <m>24 = 2\pi r</m> and therefore <m>r = \frac{12}{\pi} \approx 3.82</m>.  Hence, the point where <m>d = 6</m> (located <m>1/4</m> of the way along the circle) is at a height of <m>h = \frac{12}{\pi} \approx 3.82</m>.  Doubling this value, the point where <m>d = 12</m> has height <m>h = \frac{24}{\pi} \approx 7.64</m>.  Other heights, such as those that correspond to <m>d = 3</m> and <m>d = 15</m> (identified on the figure by the green line segments) are not obvious from the circle's radius, but can be estimated from the grid in <xref ref="F-traversing-first-example">Figure</xref> as <m>h \approx 1.1</m> (for <m>d = 3</m>) and <m>h \approx 6.5</m> (for <m>d = 15</m>).  Using all of these observations along with the symmetry of the circle, we can determine the other entries in <xref ref="T-traversing-first-example-1">Table</xref>.

		  It is apparent that each point on the circle corresponds to one and only one height, and thus we can view the height of a point as a function of the distance the point has traversed around the circle, say <m>h = f(d)</m>.  Using the data from the two tables and connecting the points in an intuitive way, we get the graph shown in <xref ref="F-traversing-first-example-graph">Figure</xref>.
	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-traversing-first-example-graph">

          <p>
		The function <m>h = f(d)</m> we have been discussing is an example of what we will call a <em>circular function</em>.  <idx><h>circular function</h></idx> Indeed, it is apparent that if we 
		<ul><li>
				<p>
					take any circle in the plane,
				</p>
			</li><li>
				<p>
					choose a starting location for a point on the circle,
				</p>
			</li><li>
				<p>
					let the point traverse the circle continuously,
				</p>
			</li><li>
				<p>
					and track the height of the point as it traverses the circle,
				</p>
			</li></ul>
		the height of the point is a function of distance traversed and the resulting graph will have the same basic shape as the curve shown in <xref ref="F-traversing-first-example-graph">Figure</xref>.  It also turns out that if we track the location of the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the point on the circle, the <m>x</m>-coordinate is also a function of distance traversed and its curve has a similar shape to the graph of the height of the point (the <m>y</m>-coordinate).  Both of these functions are circular functions because they are generated by motion around a circle.

          <title>Properties of Circular Functions</title>
          <p>
		Every circular function has several important features that are connected to the circle that defines the function.  For the discussion that follows, we focus on circular functions that result from tracking the <m>y</m>-coordinate of a point traversing counterclockwise a circle of radius <m>a</m> centered at the point <m>(k,m)</m>.  Further, we will denote the circumference of the circle by the letter <m>p</m>.
	</p>
          <sidebyside widths="33% 66%">
            <figure xml:id="F-circular-functions-properties-circle">
              <caption>A point traversing the circle.</caption>
              <image source="images/traversing-circular-properties-circle"/>
            </figure>
            <figure xml:id="F-act-circular-functions-properties-graph">
              <caption>Plotting <m>h</m> as a function of <m>d</m>.</caption>
              <image source="images/traversing-circular-properties-graph"/>
            </figure>
          </sidebyside>
          <p>
		We assume that the point traversing the circle starts at <m>P</m> in <xref ref="F-circular-functions-properties-circle">Figure</xref>.  Its height is initially <m>y = m + a</m>, and then its height decreases to <m>y = m</m> as we traverse to <m>Q</m>.  Continuing, the point's height falls to <m>y = m - a</m> at <m>R</m>, and then rises back to <m>y = m</m> at <m>S</m>, and eventually back up to <m>y = m+a</m> at the top of the circle.  If we plot these heights continuously as a function of distance, <m>d</m>, traversed around the circle, we get the curve shown at right in <xref ref="F-act-circular-functions-properties-graph">Figure</xref>.  This curve has several important features for which we introduce important terminology. 
	</p>
          <p>
		The <term>midline</term> <idx><h>circular function</h><h>midline</h></idx> of a circular function is the horizontal line <m>y = m</m> for which half the curve lies above the line and half the curve lies below.  If the circular function results from tracking the <m>y</m>-coordinate of a point traversing a circle, <m>y = m</m> corresponds to the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the center of the circle.  In addition, the <term>amplitude</term> <idx><h>circular function</h><h>amplitude</h></idx> of a circular function is the maximum deviation of the curve from the midline.  Note particularly that the value of the amplitude, <m>a</m>, corresponds to the radius of the circle that generates the curve.
	</p>
          <p>
		Because we can traverse the circle in either direction and for as far as we wish, the domain of any circular function is the set of all real numbers.  From our observations about the midline and amplitude, it follows that the range of a circular function <idx><h>circular function</h><h>range</h></idx> with midline <m>y = m</m> and amplitude <m>a</m> is the interval <m>[m-a,m+a]</m>.
	</p>
          <p>
		Finally, we introduce the formal definition of a <term>periodic</term> function.
	</p>
          <definition>
            <idx>
              <h>function</h>
              <h>periodic</h>
            </idx>
            <idx>
              <h>period</h>
            </idx>
            <statement>
              <p>
				Let <m>f</m> be a function whose domain and codomain are each the set of all real numbers.  We say that <m>f</m> is <term>periodic</term> provided that there exists a real number <m>k</m> such that <m>f(x+k) = f(x)</m> for every possible choice of <m>x</m>.  The smallest value <m>p</m> for which <m>f(x+p) = f(x)</m> for every choice of <m>x</m> is called the <term>period</term> of <m>f</m>.
			</p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
		For a circular function, the period is always the circumference of the circle that generates the curve.  In <xref ref="F-act-circular-functions-properties-graph">Figure</xref>, we see how the curve has completed one full cycle of behavior every <m>p</m> units, regardless of where we start on the curve.
	</p>
          <p>
		Circular functions arise as models for important phenomena in the world around us, such as in a <em>harmonic oscillator</em>. <idx><h>harmonic oscillator</h></idx>  Consider a mass attached to a spring where the mass sits on a frictionless surface.  After setting the mass in motion by stretching or compressing the spring, the mass will oscillate indefinitely back and forth, and its distance from a fixed point on the surface turns out to be given by a circular function.

			A weight is placed on a frictionless table next to a wall and attached to a spring that is fixed to the wall.  From its natural position of rest, the weight is imparted an initial velocity that sets it in motion.  The weight then oscillates back and forth,
      		and we can measure its distance, <m>h = f(t)</m> (in inches)
      		from the wall at any given time, <m>t</m> (in seconds).

          <title>The average rate of change of a circular function</title>
          <p>
  		Just as there are important trends in the values of a circular function, there are also interesting patterns in the average rate of change of the function.  These patterns are closely tied to the geometry of the circle.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		For the next part of our discussion, we consider a circle of radius <m>1</m> centered at <m>(0,0)</m>, and consider a point that travels a distance <m>d</m> counterclockwise around the circle with its starting point viewed as <m>(1,0)</m>.  We use this circle to generate the circular function <m>h = f(d)</m> that tracks the height of the point at the moment the point has traversed <m>d</m> units around the circle from <m>(1,0)</m>.  Let's consider the average rate of change of <m>f</m> on several intervals that are connected to certain fractions of the circumference.

  		Remembering that <m>h</m> is a function of distance traversed along the circle, it follows that the average rate of change of <m>h</m> on any interval of distance between two points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> on the circle is given by
  		<me>
  			AV_{[P,Q]} = \frac{\text{change in height}}{\text{distance along the circle}}
  		</me>,
  		where both quantities are measured from point <m>P</m> to point <m>Q</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		First, in <xref ref="F-circular-traversing-aroc-eighth">Figure</xref>, we consider points <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>R</m> where <m>Q</m> results from traversing <m>1/8</m> of the circumference from <m>P</m>, and <m>R</m> <m>1/8</m> of the circumference from <m>Q</m>.  In particular, we note that the distance <m>d_1</m> along the circle from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> is the same as the distance <m>d_2</m> along the circle from <m>Q</m> to <m>R</m>, and thus <m>d_1 = d_2</m>.  At the same time, it is apparent from the geometry of the circle that the change in height <m>h_1</m> from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> is greater than the change in height <m>h_2</m> from <m>Q</m> to <m>R</m>, so <m>h_1 \gt h_2</m>.  Thus, we can say that
  		<me>
  			AV_{[P,Q]} = \frac{h_1}{d_1} \gt \frac{h_2}{d_2} = AV_{[Q,R]} 
  		</me>.

          </sidebyside>
          <p>
  		The differences in certain average rates of change appear to become more extreme if we consider shorter arcs along the circle.  Next we consider traveling <m>1/20</m> of the circumference along the circle.  In <xref ref="F-circular-traversing-aroc-20th">Figure</xref>, points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> lie <m>1/20</m> of the circumference apart, as do <m>R</m> and <m>S</m>, so here <m>d_1 = d_5</m>.  In this situation, it is the case that <m>h_1 \gt h_5</m> for the same reasons as above, but we can say even more.  From the green triangle in <xref ref="F-circular-traversing-aroc-20th">Figure</xref>, we see that <m>h_1 \approx d_1</m> (while <m>h_1 \lt d_1</m>), so that <m>AV_{[P,Q]} = \frac{h_1}{d_1} \approx 1</m>.  At the same time, in the magenta triangle in the figure we see that <m>h_5</m> is very small, especially in comparison to <m>d_5</m>, and thus <m>AV_{[R,S]} = \frac{h_5}{d_5} \approx 0</m>.  Hence, in <xref ref="F-circular-traversing-aroc-20th">Figure</xref>,
  		<me>
  			AV_{[P,Q]} \approx 1 \text{ and } AV_{[R,S]} \approx 0
   		</me>.
   		This information tells us that a circular function appears to change most rapidly for points near its midline and to change least rapidly for points near its highest and lowest values.  
  	</p>
          <p>
  		We can study the average rate of change not only on the circle itself, but also on a graph such as <xref ref="F-act-circular-functions-properties-graph">Figure</xref>, and thus make conclusions about where the function is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down.

            <li>
  			<p>
  				When a point traverses a circle, a corresponding function can be generated by tracking the height of the point as it moves around the circle, where height is viewed as a function of distance traveled around the circle.  We call such a function a <em>circular function</em>.  An image that shows how a circular function's graph is generated from the circle can be seen in <xref ref="F-act-circular-functions-properties-graph">Figure</xref>.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				Circular functions have several standard features.  The function has a <em>midline</em> that is the line for which half the points on the curve lie above the line and half the points on the curve lie below.  A circular function's <em>amplitude</em> is the maximum deviation of the function value from the midline; the amplitude corresponds to the radius of the circle that generates the function.  Circular functions also repeat themselves, and we call the smallest value of <m>p</m> for which <m>f(x+p) = f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> the period of the function.  The period of a circular function corresponds to the circumference of the circle that generates the function.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				Non-constant linear functions are either always increasing or always decreasing; quadratic functions are either always concave up or always concave down.  Circular functions are sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing, plus sometimes concave up and sometimes concave down.  These behaviors are closely tied to the geometry of the circle.

      (a) The graph appears to have a period of 60.  Every change in the
      <m>x</m> value of 60 brings us back to the same <m>y</m> value.
      
      
      
      (b) The midline of the graph is 7 since
      <me>\mbox{midline} = \frac{ y_{max} + y_{min} }{2} =
      \frac{  17  - 3 }{2} = 7.</me>
      
      
      
      (c) The amplitude is how much the maximum or minimum <m>y</m> value differs
      from the average (midline).  Since the maximum <m>y</m> value is 17 and
      the midline is 7, the amplitude is <m>17 - 7 = 10</m>.

      (a) Since the ferris wheel makes one full rotation every 14 minutes,
      the period is 14 minutes.
      
      
      
      (b) The midline is the height when you are halfway up the ferris wheel.
      If the ferris wheel has a diameter of 140 meters and the loading
      platform is 8 meters above the ground, the height midway up the ferris
      wheel is <m>\frac{140}{2} + 8 = 78</m>.  So the midline is
      <m>h = 78</m> meters.
      
      
      
      (c) The amplitude is the difference of your height on top of the ferris
      wheel and your height at the midline (or halfway up the ferris wheel).
      When you are highest on the ferris wheel, your height is
      <m>140 + 8 = 148</m>.  Therefore the amplitude is
      <m>148 - 78 = 70</m> meters.
      
      
      
      (d) Based on the answers above, the correct answer is graph B.

      (a) The weight's initial distance from the ceiling is at its smallest value 3 cm.  Thus the weight starts at its closest position from the ceiling.  It then begins to head down away from the ceiling towards the floor.
      
      
      
      (b) The period of the graph is 0.5, therefore it takes the weight 0.5 seconds to go through one full oscillation and return to its starting position.
      
      
      
      (c) The weight gets as close as 3 cm to the ceiling.
      
      
      
      (d) The weight falls as far as 19 cm from the ceiling.
      
      
      
      (e) The amplitude of the graph is the distance of the maximum (or minimum) <m>y</m> value from the midline.  In this case the midline is <m>d=11</m> and the maximum value is <m>d=19</m>, so the amplitude is 8.

      (a) The period is 5 hours.  This is the time required for the
      temperature to cycle from <m>10^\circ</m> to <m>135^\circ</m> and back to <m>10^\circ</m>.

      (c) The amplitude is <m>62.5^\circ</m> since this is the amount of
      temperature variation (up or down) from the average.

        <introduction>
          <p>
  		As demonstrated by several different examples in <xref ref="sec-circular-traversing">Section</xref>, certain periodic phenomena are closely linked to circles and circular motion.  Rather than regularly work with circles of different center and radius, it turns out to be ideal to work with one standard circle and build all circular functions from it.  The <term>unit circle</term> <idx><h>unit circle</h></idx>is the circle of radius <m>1</m> that is centered at the origin, <m>(0,0)</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		If we pick any point <m>(x,y)</m> that lies on the unit circle, the point is associated with a right triangle whose horizontal leg has length <m>|x|</m> and whose vertical leg has length <m>|y|</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-unit-circle-eqn">Figure</xref>.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, it follows that 
  		<me>
  			x^2 + y^2 = 1
  		</me>,
  		and this is the equation of the unit circle:  a point <m>(x,y)</m> lies on the unit circle if and only if <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>.
  	</p>

          <p>
		To study the circular functions generated by the unit circle, we will also animate a point and let it traverse the circle.  Starting at <m>(1,0)</m> indicated by <m>t_0</m> in <xref ref="F-unit-circle-24s">Figure</xref>, we see a sequence of points that result from traveling a distance along the circle that is <m>1/24</m> the circumference of the unit circle.  Since the unit circle's circumference is <m>C = 2\pi r = 2\pi</m>, it follows that the distance from <m>t_0</m> to <m>t_1</m> is 
		<me>
			d = \frac{1}{24} \cdot 2\pi = \frac{\pi}{12}
		</me>.
		As we work to better understand the unit circle, we will commonly use fractional multiples of <m>\pi</m> as these result in natural distances traveled along the unit circle.

          <title>Radians and degrees</title>
          <p>
      In <xref ref="PA-circular-unit-circle">Preview Activity</xref>, we introduced the idea of radian measure of an angle.  Here we state the formal definition of this term.
    </p>
          <definition>
            <idx>
              <h>radian measure</h>
              <h>definition of</h>
            </idx>
            <statement>
              <p>
          An angle whose vertex is at the center of a circle<fn>We often call such an angle a <em>central angle</em>.</fn> measures <term><m>1</m> radian</term> provided that the arc the angle intercepts on the circle equals the radius of the circle.
        </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
      As seen in <xref ref="F-PA-unit-circle-defining-radian">Figure</xref>, in the unit circle this means that a central angle has measure <m>1</m> radian whenever it intercepts an arc of length <m>1</m> unit along the circumference.  Because of this important correspondence between the unit circle and radian measure (one unit of arc length on the unit circle corresponds to <m>1</m> radian), we focus our discussion of radian measure within the unit circle. 
    </p>
          <p>
      Since there are <m>2\pi</m> units of length along the unit circle's circumference it follows there are <m>\frac{1}{4} \cdot 2\pi = \frac{\pi}{2}</m> units of length in <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of a revolution.  We also know that <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of a revolution corresponds to a central angle that is a right angle, whose familiar degree measure is <m>90^\circ</m>.  If we extend to a central angle that intercepts half the circle, we see similarly that <m>\pi</m> radians corresponds to <m>180^\circ</m>; this relationship enables us to convert angle measures from radians to degrees and vice versa.

      <title>Converting between radians and degrees</title>
      <p>
        An angle whose radian measure is <m>1</m> radian has degree measure <m>\frac{180}{\pi} ^\circ</m>.  An angle whose degree measure is <m>1^\circ</m> has radian measure <m>\frac{\pi}{180}</m>.

      Note that in <xref ref="F-PA-big-unit-circle">Figure</xref> in the Preview Activity, we labeled <m>24</m> equally spaced points with their respective distances around the unit circle counterclockwise from <m>(1,0)</m>.  Because these distances are on the unit circle, they also correspond to the radian measure of the central angles that intercept them.  In particular, each central angle with one of its sides on the positive <m>x</m>-axis generates a unique point on the unit circle, and with it, an associated length intercepted along the circumference of the circle.  A good exercise at this point is to return to <xref ref="F-PA-big-unit-circle">Figure</xref> and label each of the noted points with the degree measure that is intercepted by a central angle with one side on the positive <m>x</m>-axis, in addition to the arc lengths (radian measures) already identified.

          <title>Special points on the unit circle</title>
          <p>
      Our in-depth study of the unit circle is motivated by our desire to better understand the behavior of circular functions.  Recall that as we traverse a circle, the height of the point moving along the circle generates a function that depends on distance traveled along the circle.  Wherever possible, we'd like to be able to identify the exact height of a given point on the unit circle.  Two special right triangles enable us to locate exactly an important collection of points on the unit circle.

          <p>
      In addition, we note that there are four additional points on the circle that we can locate exactly:  the four points that correspond to angle measures of <m>0</m>, <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, <m>\pi</m>, and <m>\frac{3\pi}{2}</m> radians, which lie where the coordinate axes intersect the circle.  Each such point has <m>0</m> for one coordinate and <m>\pm 1</m> for the other.  Labeling all of the remaining points in <xref ref="F-unit-circle-big-labeled">Figure</xref> is an important exercise that you should do on your own.
    </p>
          <p>
      Finally, we note that we can identify any point on the unit circle exactly simply by choosing one of its coordinates.  Since every point <m>(x,y)</m> on the unit circle satisfies the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>, if we know the value of <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> and the quadrant in which the point lies, we can determine the other coordinate exactly.

          <title>Special points and arc length in non-unit circles</title>
          <p>
      All of our work with the unit circle can be extended to circles centered at the origin with different radii, since a circle with a larger or smaller radius is a scaled version of the unit circle.  For instance, if we instead consider a circle of radius <m>7</m>, the coordinates of every point on the unit circle are magnified by a factor of <m>7</m>, so the point that corresponds to an angle such as <m>\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}</m> has coordinates <m>\left( -\frac{7}{2}, \frac{7\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)</m>.  Distance along the circle is magnified by the same factor:  the arc length along the unit circle from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>\left( -\frac{7}{2}, \frac{7\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)</m> is <m>7 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{3}</m>, since the arc length along the unit circle for this angle is <m>\frac{2\pi}{3}</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      If we think more generally about a circle of radius <m>r</m> with a central angle <m>\theta</m> that intercepts an arc of length <m>s</m>, we see how the magnification factor <m>r</m> (in comparison to the unit circle) connects arc length and the central angle according to the following principle.
    </p>
          <assemblage>
      <title>Connecting arc length and angles in non-unit circles</title>
      <p>
        If a central angle measuring <m>\theta</m> radians intercepts an arc of length <m>s</m> in a circle of radius <m>r</m>, then
        <me>
          s = r \theta
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the unit circle, where <m>r = 1</m>, the equation <m>s = r\theta</m> demonstrates the familiar fact that arc length matches the radian measure of the central angle.  Moreover, we also see how this formula aligns with the definition of radian measure:  if the arc length and radius are equal, then the angle measures <m>1</m> radian.

          <ul>
            <li>
        <p>
          The radian measure of an angle connects the measure of a central angle in a circle to the radius of the circle.  A central angle has radian measure <m>1</m> provided that it intercepts an arc of length equal to the circle's radius.  In the unit circle, a central angle's radian measure is precisely the same numerical value as the length of the arc it intercepts along the circle.
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          If we begin at the point <m>(1,0)</m> and move counterclockwise along the unit circle, there are natural special points on the unit circle that correspond to angles of measure <m>30^\circ</m>, <m>45^\circ</m>, <m>60^\circ</m>, and their multiples.  We can count in <m>30^\circ</m> increments and identify special points that correspond to angles of measure <m>30^\circ</m>, <m>60^\circ</m>, <m>90^\circ</m>, <m>120^\circ</m>, and so on; doing likewise with <m>45^\circ</m>, these correspond to angles of <m>45^\circ</m>, <m>90^\circ</m>, <m>135^\circ</m>, etc.  In radian measure, these sequences together give us the important angles <m>\frac{\pi}{6}</m>, <m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m>, <m>\frac{\pi}{3}</m>, <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, <m>\frac{2\pi}{3}</m>, <m>\frac{3\pi}{4}</m>, and so on.  Together with our work involving <m>45^\circ</m>-<m>45^\circ</m>-<m>90^\circ</m> and <m>30^\circ</m>-<m>60^\circ</m>-<m>90^\circ</m> triangles in <xref ref="act-circular-unit-circle-special-triangles">Activity</xref>, we are able to identify the exact locations of all of the points in <xref ref="F-unit-circle-big-labeled">Figure</xref>.
        </p>
      </li>
            <li>
        <p>
          In any circle of radius <m>r</m>, if a central angle of measure <m>\theta</m> radians intercepts an arc of length <m>s</m>, then it follows that 
          <me>
            s = r\theta
          </me>.
          This shows that arc length, <m>s</m>, is magnified along with the size of the radius, <m>r</m>, of the circle.

  		In <xref ref="sec-circular-traversing">Section</xref>, we saw how tracking the height of a point that is traversing a cirle generates a periodic function, such as in <xref ref="F-act-circular-functions-properties-graph">Figure</xref>.  Then, in <xref ref="sec-circular-unit-circle">Section</xref>, we identified a collection of <m>16</m> special points on the unit circle, as seen in <xref ref="F-circular-sine-all-16">Figure</xref>.

          <p>
  		The circular function that tracks the height of a point on the unit circle traversing counterclockwise from <m>(1,0)</m> as a function of the corresponding central angle (in radians) is one of the most important functions in mathematics.  As such, we give the function a name:  the <term>sine</term> function.

          <p>
			Because of the correspondence between radian angle measure and distance traversed on the unit circle, we can also think of <m>\sin(t)</m> as identifying the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the point after it has traveled <m>t</m> units counterclockwise along the circle from <m>(1,0)</m>.  Note particularly that we can consider the sine of negative inputs:  for instance, <m>\sin(-\frac{\pi}{2}) = -1</m>.

  		Given any central angle of radian measure <m>t</m> in the unit circle with one side passing through the point <m>(1,0)</m>, the angle generates a unique point <m>(a,b)</m> that lies on the circle.  Just as we can view the <m>y</m>-coordinate as a function of <m>t</m>, the <m>x</m>-coordinate is likewise a function of <m>t</m>.  We therefore make the following definition.

  		As we work with the sine and cosine functions, it's always helpful to remember their definitions in terms of the unit circle and the motion of a point traversing the circle.  At <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0xe">http://gvsu.edu/s/0xe</url> you can explore and investigate a helpful <em>Desmos</em> animation that shows how this motion around the circle generates each of the respective graphs.

		It is also insightful to juxtapose the sine and cosine functions' graphs on the same coordinate axes.  When we do, as seen in <xref ref="F-sine-cosine-both">Figure</xref>, we see that the curves can be viewed as horizontal translations of one another.

		In particular, since the sine graph can be viewed as the cosine graph shifted <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> units to the right, it follows that for any value of <m>t</m>,
		<me>
			\sin(t) = \cos(t-\frac{\pi}{2})
		</me>.
		Similarly, since the cosine graph can be viewed as the sine graph shifted left,
		<me>
			\cos(t) = \sin(t + \frac{\pi}{2})
		</me>.
		Because each of the two preceding equations hold for every value of <m>t</m>, they are often referred to as <em>identities</em>.
	</p>
          <p>
		In light of the definitions of the sine and cosine functions, we can now view any point <m>(x,y)</m> on the unit circle as being of the form <m>(\cos(t),\sin(t))</m>, where <m>t</m> is the measure of the angle whose vertices are <m>(1,0)</m>, <m>(0,0)</m>, and <m>(x,y)</m>.  Note particularly that since <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>, it is also true that <m>\cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) = 1</m>.  We call this fact the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity.

  		We have established that we know the exact value of <m>\sin(t)</m> and <m>\cos(t)</m> for any of the <m>t</m>-values in <xref ref="T-circular-sine-values">Table</xref>, as well as for any such <m>t \pm 2j\pi</m>, where <m>j</m> is a whole number, due to the periodicity of the functions.  But what if we want to know <m>\sin(1.35)</m> or <m>\cos(\frac{\pi}{5})</m> or values for other inputs not in the table?
  	</p>
          <p>
  		Any standard computing device such as a scientific calculator, <em>Desmos</em>, <em>Geogebra</em>, or <em>WolframAlpha</em>, has the ability to evaluate the sine and cosine functions at any input we desire.  Because the input is viewed as an angle, each computing device has the option to consider the angle in radians or degrees.  <em>It is always essential that you are sure which type of input your device is expecting.</em>  Our computational device of choice is <em>Desmos</em>.  In <em>Desmos</em>, you can change the input type between radians and degrees by clicking the wrench icon in the upper right and choosing the desired units.  Radian measure is the default.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		It takes substantial and sophisticated mathematics to enable a computational device to evaluate the sine and cosine functions at any value we want; the algorithms involve an idea from calculus known as an infinite series.  While your computational device is powerful, it's both helpful and important to understand the meaning of these values on the unit circle and to remember the special points for which we know the outputs of the sine and cosine functions exactly.

          <ul>

  			<p>
  				The sine and cosine functions result from tracking the <m>y</m>- and <m>x</m>-coordinates of a point traversing the unit circle counterclockwise from <m>(1,0)</m>.  The value of <m>\sin(t)</m> is the <m>y</m>-coordinate of a point that has traversed <m>t</m> units along the circle from <m>(1,0)</m> (or equivalently that corresponds to an angle of <m>t</m> radians), while the value of <m>\cos(t)</m> is the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the same point.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				The sine and cosine functions are both periodic functions that share the same domain (the set of all real numbers), range (the interval <m>[-1,1]</m>), midline (<m>y = 0</m>), amplitude (<m>a = 1</m>), and period (<m>P = 2\pi</m>).  In addition, the sine function is horizontal shift of the cosine function by <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> units to the right, so <m>\sin(t) = \cos(t-\frac{\pi}{2})</m> for any value of <m>t</m>.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				If <m>t</m> corresponds to one of the special angles that we know on the unit circle (as in <xref ref="F-circular-sine-all-16">Figure</xref>), we can compute the values of <m>\sin(t)</m> and <m>\cos(t)</m>exactly.  For other values of <m>t</m>, we can use a computational device to estimate the value of either function at a given input; when we do so, we must take care to know whether we are computing in terms of radians or degrees.

      a)  The coordinate of the point <m>S</m> are <m>(x_0,y_0) = ( a, \sin{(a)} )</m> while the coordinates of the point <m>T</m> are <m>(x_1,y_1) = ( a+h, \sin{(a+h)} )</m>.  Thus the slope between these two points can be expressed as
      
      
         
      
      
      <m>\displaystyle \mbox{slope} = \frac{ y_1 - y_0 }{x_1-x_0} = \frac{ \sin{(a+h)} - \sin{(a)} }{ (a+h) - a} = \frac{ \sin{(a+h)} - \sin{(a)} }{h}</m>
      
      
         
      
      
      b) Plugging in the values <m>a = 1.6</m> and <m>h = 0.01</m> into the expression above you find <m>\mbox{slope} \approx -0.03</m>.

        We now know three different identities involving the sine and cosine functions: <m>\sin(t+\frac{\pi}{2}) = \cos(t)</m>, <m>\cos(t-\frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin(t)</m>, and <m>\cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) = 1</m>.  Following are several proposed identities.  For each, your task is to decide whether the identity is true or false.  If true, give a convincing argument for why it is true; if false, give an example of a <m>t</m>-value for which the equation fails to hold.

  		Recall our work in <xref ref="sec-changing-transformations">Section</xref>, where we studied how the graph of the function <m>g</m> defined by <m>g(x) = af(x-b) + c</m> is related to the graph of <m>f</m>, where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are real numbers with <m>a \ne 0</m>.  Because such transformations can shift and stretch a function, we are interested in understanding how we can use transformations of the sine and cosine functions to fit formulas to circular functions.

          <title>Shifts and vertical stretches of the sine and cosine functions</title>
          <p>
  		We know that the standard functions <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m> and <m>g(t) = \cos(t)</m> are circular functions that each have midline <m>y = 0</m>, amplitude <m>a = 1</m>, period <m>p = 2\pi</m>, and range <m>[-1,1]</m>.  Our work in <xref ref="PA-circular-sinusoidal">Preview Activity</xref> suggests the following general principles.
  	</p>
          <assemblage xml:id="asm-sinusoidal-first-transformations">
  		<title>Transformations of sine and cosine</title>
  		<p>
  			Given real numbers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> with <m>a \ne 0</m>, the functions
  			<me>
  				k(t) = a\cos(t-b)+c \ \text{ and } \ h(t) = a\sin(t-b) + c
  			</me>
  			each represent a horizontal shift by <m>b</m> units to the right, followed by a vertical stretch by <m>|a|</m> units (if <m>a \lt 0</m>, there is also a reflection across the <m>x</m>-axis), followed by a vertical shift of <m>c</m> units, applied to the parent function (<m>\cos(t)</m> or <m>\sin(t)</m>, respectively).  The resulting circular functions have midline <m>y = c</m>, amplitude <m>|a|</m>, range <m>[c-|a|,c+|a|]</m>, and period <m>p = 2\pi</m>.  In addition, the point <m>(b,a+c)</m> lies on the graph of <m>k</m> and the point <m>(b,c)</m> lies on the graph of <m>h</m>.
  		</p>
  	</assemblage>
          <p>
  		In <xref ref="F-sinusoidal-cosine-transf">Figure</xref>, we see how the overall transformation <m>k(t) = a\cos(t-b)+c</m> comes from executing a sequence of simpler ones.  The original parent function <m>y = \cos(t)</m> (in dark gray) is first shifted <m>b</m> units right to generate the light red graph of <m>y = \cos(t - b)</m>.  In turn, that graph is then scaled vertically by <m>a</m> to generate the purple graph of <m>y = a\cos(t-b)</m>.  Finally, the purple graph is shifted <m>c</m> units vertically to result in the final graph of <m>y = a\cos(t-b) + c</m> in blue.
  	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-sinusoidal-cosine-transf">
            <caption>A sequence of transformations of <m>y = \cos(t)</m>.</caption>
            <image width="80%" source="images/sinusoidal-transformed-cosine"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
  		It is often useful to follow one particular point through a sequence of transformations.  In <xref ref="F-sinusoidal-cosine-transf">Figure</xref>, we see the red point that is located at <m>(0,1)</m> on the original function <m>y = \cos(t)</m>, as well as the point <m>(b, a+c)</m> that is the corresponding point on <m>k(t) = a\cos(t-b) + c</m> under the overall transformation.  Note that the point <m>(b,a+c)</m> results from the input, <m>t = b</m>, that makes the argument of the cosine function zero:  <m>k(b) = a\cos(b-b) + c = a\cos(0) + c</m>.  
  	</p>
          <p>
  		While the sine and cosine functions extend infinitely in either direction, it's natural to think of the point <m>(0,1)</m> as the <q>starting point</q> of the cosine function, and similarly the point <m>(0,0)</m> as the starting point of the sine function.  We will refer to the corresponding points <m>(b,a+c)</m> and <m>(b,c)</m> on <m>k(t) = a\cos(t-b) + c</m> and <m>h(t) = a\sin(t-b) + c</m> as <term>anchor points</term>. <idx><h>sinusoidal function</h><h>anchor point</h></idx>  Anchor points, along with other information about a circular function's amplitude, midline, and period help us to determine a formula for a function that fits a given situation.

          <title>Horizontal scaling</title>
          <p>
		There is one more very important transformation of a function that we've not yet explored.  Given a function <m>y = f(x)</m>, we want to understand the related function <m>g(x) = f(kx)</m>, where <m>k</m> is a positive real number.  The sine and cosine functions are ideal functions with which to explore these effects; moreover, this transformation is crucial for being able to use the sine and cosine functions to model phenomena that oscillate at different frequencies.
	</p>
          <p>
		In the interactive <xref ref="F-transformations-horizontal-scaling">Figure</xref>,  we can explore the effect of the transformation <m>g(t) = f(kt)</m>, where <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m>.
	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-transformations-horizontal-scaling">

					Move the slider by clicking and dragging on the red point to see how changing <m>k</m> affects the graph of <m>y = f(kt)</m>.  The graph of <m>y = f(t)</m> will appear in grey and remain fixed. 
				</p>
			</instructions>
		</interactive>
          </figure>
          <p>
		By experimenting with the slider, we gain an intuitive sense for how the value of <m>k</m> affects the graph of <m>h(t) = f(kt)</m> in comparision to the graph of <m>f(t)</m>.  When <m>k = 2</m>, we see that the graph of <m>h</m> is oscillating twice as fast as the graph of <m>f</m> since <m>h(t) = f(2t)</m> completes two full cycles over an interval in which <m>f</m> completes one full cycle.  In contrast, when <m>k = \frac{1}{2}</m>, the graph of <m>h</m> oscillates half as fast as the graph of <m>f</m>, as <m>h(t) = f(\frac{1}{2}t)</m> completes only half of one cycle over an interval where <m>f(t)</m> completes a full one.
	</p>
          <p>
		We can also understand this from the perspective of function composition.  To evaluate <m>h(t) = f(2t)</m>, at a given value of <m>t</m>, we first multiply the input <m>t</m> by a factor of <m>2</m>, and then evaluate the function <m>f</m> at the result.  An important observation is that 
		<me>
			h\left( \frac{1}{2}t \right) = f\left( 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}t \right) = f(t)
		</me>.
		This tells us that the point <m>(\frac{1}{2}t, f(t))</m> lies on the graph of <m>h</m> since an input of <m>\frac{1}{2}t</m> in <m>h</m> results in the value <m>f(t)</m>.  At the same time, the point <m>(t,f(t))</m> lies on the graph of <m>f</m>.  Thus we see that the correlation between points on the graphs of <m>f</m> and <m>h</m> (where <m>h(t) = f(2t)</m>) is
		<me>
			(t, f(t)) \rightarrow \left( \frac{1}{2}t, f(t) \right)
		</me>.
		We can therefore think of the transformation <m>h(t) = f(2t)</m> as achieving the output values of <m>f</m> twice as fast as the original function <m>f(t)</m> does.  Analogously, the transformation <m>h(t) = f(\frac{1}{2}t)</m> will achieve the output values of <m>f</m> only half as quickly as the original function.

  		<p>
  			Given a function <m>y = f(t)</m> and a real number <m>k \gt 0</m>, the transformed function <m>y = h(t) = f(kt)</m> is a <em>horizontal stretch</em> of the graph of <m>f</m>.  Every point <m>(t,f(t))</m> on the graph of <m>f</m> gets stretched horizontally to the corresponding point <m>(\frac{1}{k}t,f(t))</m> on the graph of <m>h</m>.  If <m>0 \lt k \lt 1</m>, the graph of <m>h</m> is a stretch of <m>f</m> away from the <m>y</m>-axis by a factor of <m>\frac{1}{k}</m>; if <m>k \gt 1</m>, the graph of <m>h</m> is a compression of <m>f</m> toward the <m>y</m>-axis by a factor of <m>\frac{1}{k}</m>.  The only point on the graph of <m>f</m> that is unchanged by the transformation is <m>(0,f(0))</m>.
  		</p>
  	</assemblage>
          <p>
  		While we will soon focus on horizontal stretches of the sine and cosine functions for the remainder of this section, it's important to note that horizontal scaling follows the same principles for any function we choose.

          <title>Circular functions with different periods</title>
          <p>
  		Because the circumference of the unit circle is <m>2\pi</m>, the sine and cosine functions each have period <m>2\pi</m>.  Of course, as we think about using transformations of the sine and cosine functions to model different phenomena, it is apparent that we will need to generate functions with different periods than <m>2\pi</m>.  For instance, if a ferris wheel makes one revolution every <m>5</m> minutes, we'd want the period of the function that models the height of one car as a function of time to be <m>P = 5</m>.  Horizontal scaling of functions enables us to generate circular functions with any period we desire.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		We begin by considering two basic examples.  First, let <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m> and <m>g(t) = f(2t) = \sin(2t)</m>.  We know from our most recent work that this transformation results in a horizontal compression of the graph of <m>\sin(t)</m> by a factor of <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> toward the <m>y</m>-axis.  If we plot the two functions on the same axes as seen in <xref ref="F-sinusoidal-sine-compressed">Figure</xref>, it becomes apparent how this transformation affects the period of <m>f</m>.
  	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-sinusoidal-sine-compressed">
            <caption>A plot of the parent function, <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m> (dashed, in gray), and the transformed function <m>g(t) = f(2t) = \sin(2t)</m> (in blue).</caption>
            <image source="images/sinusoidal-sine-horiz-scaling" width="75%"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
  		From the graph, we see that <m>g(t) = \sin(2t)</m> oscillates twice as frequently as <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m>, and that <m>g</m> completes a full cycle on the interval <m>[0,\pi]</m>, which is half the length of the period of <m>f</m>.  Thus, the  <q><m>2</m></q> in <m>f(2t)</m> causes the period of <m>f</m> to be <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> as long; specifially, the period of <m>g</m> is <m>P = \frac{1}{2} (2\pi) = \pi</m>.
  	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-sinusoidal-sine-stretched">
            <caption>A plot of the parent function, <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m> (dashed, in gray), and the transformed function <m>h(t) = f(\frac{1}{2}t) = \sin(\frac{1}{2}t)</m> (in blue).</caption>
            <image source="images/sinusoidal-sine-horiz-scaling-2" width="75%"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
      On the other hand, if we let <m>h(t) = f(\frac{1}{2}t) = \sin(\frac{1}{2}t)</m>, the transformed graph <m>h</m> is stretched away from the <m>y</m>-axis by a factor of <m>2</m>.  This has the effect of doubling the period of <m>f</m>, so that the period of <m>h</m> is <m>P = 2 \cdot 2\pi = 4\pi</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-sinusoidal-sine-stretched">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <p>
  	Our observations generalize for any positive constant <m>k \gt 0</m>.  In the case where <m>k = 2</m>, we saw that the period of <m>g(t) = \sin(2t)</m> is <m>P = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2\pi</m>, whereas in the case where <m>k = \frac{1}{2}</m>, the period of <m>h(t) = \sin(\frac{1}{2}t)</m> is <m>P = 2 \cdot 2\pi = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2\pi</m>.  Identical reasoning holds if we are instead working with the cosine function.  In general, we can say the following.
  </p>
          <assemblage xml:id="asm-sinusoidal-period">
  	<title>The period of a circular function</title>
  	<p>
  		For any constant <m>k \gt 0</m>, the period of the functions <m>\sin(kt)</m> and <m>\cos(kt)</m> is
  		<me>
  			P = \frac{2\pi}{k}
  		</me>.
  	</p>
  </assemblage>
          <p>
		Thus, if we know the <m>k</m>-value from the given function, we can deduce the period.  If instead we know the desired period, we can determine <m>k</m> by the rule <m>k = \frac{2\pi}{P}</m>.

  				Given any circular periodic function for which the midline, amplitude, period, and an anchor point are known, we can find a corresponding formula for the function of the form 
  				<me>
  					k(t) = a\cos(k(t-b))+c \text{ or } h(t) = a\sin(k(t-b)) + c
  				</me>.
  				Each of these functions has midline <m>y = c</m>, amplitude <m>|a|</m>, and period <m>P = \frac{2\pi}{k}</m>.  The point <m>(b,a+c)</m> lies on <m>k</m> and the point <m>(b,c)</m> lies on <m>h</m>.

      <solution><alert>  SOLUTION </alert>
      
      
      
      
      Since the maximum value of the cosine function is <m>1</m> and the minimum is
      <m>-1</m>, the expression <m>-6 \cos{(7 \pi x + 2 )}</m> varies between <m>- 6</m> and <m>6</m> in value.  The subtraction of 9 means that <me>y = -6 \cos{(7 \pi x + 2)} - 9</me> varies between <m>-15</m> and <m>-3</m>.  The expression <m>7 \pi x + 2</m> inside the cosine function is a horizontal compression which affects the period and a phase shift left 2 units.  The phase shift left 2 units does not change the period, amplitude or the midline.
      
      
      
      (a) The period is equal to <m>\frac{ 2 \pi}{7 \pi} = \frac{2}{7}</m>.
      
      
      
      (b) The midline is the average value, <m>\mbox{midline} = \frac{ -3  - 15}{2} = -9</m> which can be determined by glancing at the coefficient added (subtracted) to the end of expression  <m>-6 \cos{(7 \pi x + 2 )}</m>.
      
      
      
      (c) The amplitude is the variation from the midline to the maximum or minimum.  In this example <m>\mbox{amplitude} = -3 - (-9) = 6</m>.  This can quickly be determined by taking the absolute value of the coefficient <m>-6</m> in front of the cosine in the function <me>y = -6 \cos{(7 \pi x + 2)} - 9</me>.

      This function resembles a cosine curve in that it attains its maximum when <m>x = 0</m>.
      We know that the smallest value it attains is <m>0</m> and that
      its maximum value is <m>8</m>.  Therefore its midline is
      <m>y = \frac{ 8 + 0}{2} = 4</m>, and its amplitude
      is <m>8 - 4 = 4</m>.  Thus in the equation
      <m>f(x) = A \cos{(Bx)} + k</m> we know that  <m>A = 4</m> and <m>k = 4</m>.
      Since the graph has a period of <m>8</m>, the value for
      <m>B = \frac{2 \pi}{\mbox{period}} = \frac{2 \pi}{8} = \frac{\pi}{4}</m>.
      Finally we have a formula:

      This function resembles a cosine curve in that it attains its minimum (not midline) when <m>x = 0</m>.  Since the value is at its minimum (not maximum) at <m>x = 0</m>, we need to use the formula <m>f(x) = - \cos{(x)}</m>.  We know that the smallest value it attains is <m>0</m>, that its midline is <m>y = 14</m>, so its amplitude is <m>14</m> as well.  Thus in the equation <m>f(x) = -A \cos{(Bx)} + k</m> we know that  <m>A = 14</m> and <m>k = 14</m>. Since the graph has a period of <m>10</m>, the value for <m>B = \frac{2 \pi}{\mbox{period}} = \frac{2 \pi}{10} = \frac{\pi}{5}</m>.  Finally we have a formula:

      Since the diameter is 40 meters, your height would be 20 meters when you are halfway up the ferris wheel, so the midline is <m>y = k = 20</m>.  Your maximum height is 40 meters, so the amplitude is <m>A = 20</m>.  The period is 8 minutes, so the constant <m>B = \frac{ 2 \pi}{8}</m>.  At <m>t = 0</m>, the 9 o'clock position would be halfway up the ferris wheel.  We want the graph to be at its midline when <m>t = 0</m>, so we want to use the sine function.  We also want the graph to begin decreasing at a first since the ferris wheel is descending, so we need to use a function of the form <m>f(t) = -A \sin{(Bt)} + k</m>:

        <introduction>
          <p>
  		Linear functions have constant average rate of change and model many important phenomena.  In other settings, it is natural for a quantity to change at a rate that is proportional to the amount of the quantity present.  For instance, whether you put $<m>100</m> or $<m>100000</m> or any other amount in a mutual fund, the investment's value changes at a rate proportional the amount present.  We often measure that rate in terms of the annual percentage rate of return. 
  	</p>
          <p>
  		Suppose that a certain mutual fund has a <m>10</m>% annual return.  If we invest $<m>100</m>, after <m>1</m> year we still have the original $<m>100</m>, plus we gain <m>10</m>% of $<m>100</m>, so
  		<me>
  			100 \xrightarrow{\text{year } 1} 100 + 0.1(100) = 1.1(100)
  		</me>.
  		If we instead invested $<m>100000</m>, after <m>1</m> year we again have the original $<m>100000</m>, but now we gain <m>10</m>% of $<m>100000</m>, and thus
  		<me>
  			100000 \xrightarrow{\text{year } 1} 100000 + 0.1(100000) = 1.1(100000)
  		</me>.
  		We therefore see that regardless of the amount of money originally invested, say <m>P</m>, the amount of money we have after <m>1</m> year is <m>1.1P</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		If we repeat our computations for the second year, we observe that 
  		<me>
  			1.1(100) \xrightarrow{\text{year } 2} 1.1(100) + 0.1(1.1(100) = 1.1(1.1(100)) = 1.1^2 (100)
  		</me>.
  		The ideas are identical with the larger dollar value, so
  		<me>
  			1.1(100000) \xrightarrow{\text{year } 2} 1.1(100000) + 0.1(1.1(100000) = 1.1(1.1(100000)) = 1.1^2 (100000)
  		</me>,
  		and we see that if we invest <m>P</m> dollars, in <m>2</m> years our investment will grow to <m>1.1^2 P</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		Of course, in <m>3</m> years at <m>10</m>%, the original investment <m>P</m> will have grown to <m>1.1^3 P</m>.  Here we see a new kind of pattern developing:  annual growth of <m>10</m>% is leading to <em>powers</em> of the base <m>1.1</m>, where the power to which we raise <m>1.1</m> corresponds to the number of years the investment has grown.  We often call this phenomenon <em>exponential growth</em>. <idx><h>exponential growth</h><h>introduction</h></idx>

In addition, because a positive number raised to any power is always positive (for instance, <m>2^{10} = 1096</m> and <m>2^{-10} = \frac{1}{2^{10}} = \frac{1}{2096}</m>), the output of an exponential function is also always positive.  In particular, <m>f(t) = b^t</m> is never zero and thus has no <m>x</m>-intercepts.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		Because we will be frequently interested in functions such as <m>I(t)</m> and <m>V(t)</m> with the form <m>ab^t</m>, we will also refer to functions of this form as <q>exponential</q>, understanding that technically these are vertical stretches of exponential functions according to <xref ref="D-growth-exponential-function">Definition</xref>.  In <xref ref="PA-exp-growth">Preview Activity</xref>, we found that <m>I(t) = 20000(1.08)^t</m> and <m>V(t) = 20000(0.88)^t</m>.  It is natural to call <m>1.08</m> the <q>growth factor</q>  of <m>I</m> and similarly <m>0.88</m> the growth factor of <m>V</m>.  In addition, we note that these values stem from the actual growth rates:  <m>0.08</m> for <m>I</m> and <m>-0.12</m> for <m>V</m>, the latter being negative because value is depreciating.  In general, for a function of form <m>f(t) = ab^t</m>, we call <m>b</m> the <term>growth factor</term>. <idx><h>exponential function</h><h>growth factor</h></idx>  Moreover, if <m>b = 1+r</m>, we call <m>r</m> the <term>growth rate</term>. <idx><h>exponential function</h><h>growth rate</h></idx>  Whenever <m>b \gt 1</m>, we often say that the function <m>f</m> is exhibiting <q>exponential growth</q>, wherease if <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>, we say <m>f</m> exhibits <q>exponential decay</q>. <idx><h>exponential function</h><h>exponential decay</h></idx>

          <p>
		In <xref ref="T-exp-linear-decay">Table</xref>, we see a function that exhibits constant average rate of change since the change in output is always <m>\triangle r = -2</m> for any change in input of <m>\triangle t = 3</m>.  Said differently, <m>r</m> is a linear function with slope <m>m = -\frac{2}{3}</m>.  Since its <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,12)</m>, the function's formula is <m>y = r(t) = 12 - \frac{2}{3}t</m>.
	</p>
          <p>
		In contrast, the function <m>s</m> given by <xref ref="T-exp-exponential-decay">Table</xref> does not exhibit constant average rate of change.  Instead, another pattern is present.  Observe that if we consider the ratios of consecutive outputs in the table, we see that
		<me>
			\frac{9} {12}= \frac{3}{4}, \frac{6.75}{9} = 0.75 = \frac{3}{4}, \text{ and } \frac{5.0625}{6.75} = 0.75 = \frac{3}{4}
		</me>.
		So, where the <em>differences</em> in the outputs in <xref ref="T-exp-linear-decay">Table</xref> are constant, the <em>ratios</em> in the outputs in <xref ref="T-exp-exponential-decay">Table</xref> are constant.  The latter is a hallmark of exponential functions and may be used to help us determine the formula of a function for which we have certain information.
	</p>
          <p>
  		If we know that a certain function is linear, it suffices to know two points that lie on the line to determine the function's formula.  It turns out that exponential functions are similar:  knowing two points on the graph of a function known to be exponential is enough information to determine the function's formula.  In the following example, we show how knowing two values of an exponential function enables us to find both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> exactly.
  	</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-growth-find-a-b">
            <statement>
              <p>
				Suppose that <m>p</m> is an exponential function and we know that <m>p(2) = 11</m> and <m>p(5) = 18</m>.  Determine the exact values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> for which <m>p(t) = ab^t</m>.
			</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
				Since we know that <m>p(t) = ab^t</m>, the two data points give us two equations in the unknowns <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.  First, using <m>t = 2</m>,
				<men xml:id="eq-growth-p-2">
					ab^2 = 11
				</men>,
				and using <m>t = 5</m> we also have
				<men xml:id="eq-growth-p-5">
					ab^5 = 18
				</men>.
				Because we know that the quotient of outputs of an exponential function corresponding to equally-spaced inputs must be constant, we thus naturally consider the quotient <m>\frac{18}{11}</m>.  Using <xref ref="eq-growth-p-2">Equation</xref> and <xref ref="eq-growth-p-5">Equation</xref>, it follows that
				<me>
					\frac{18}{11} = \frac{ab^5}{ab^2}
				</me>.
				Simplifying the fraction on the right, we see that 
				<m>
					\frac{18}{11} = b^3
				</m>.
				Solving for <m>b</m>, we find that <m>b = \sqrt[3]{\frac{18}{11}}</m> is the exact value of <m>b</m>.  Substituting this value for <m>b</m> in <xref ref="eq-growth-p-2">Equation</xref>, it then follows that <m>a \left( \sqrt[3]{\frac{18}{11}} \right)^2 = 11</m>, so 
				<m>
					a = \frac{11}{\left( \frac{18}{11} \right)^{2/3}}
				</m>.  Therefore,
				<me>
					p(t) = \frac{11}{\left( \frac{18}{11} \right)^{2/3}} \left( \sqrt[3]{\frac{18}{11}} \right)^t \approx 7.9215 \cdot 1.1784^t
				</me>, and a plot of <m>y = p(t)</m> confirms that the function indeed passes through <m>(2,11)</m> and <m>(5,18)</m> as shown in <xref ref="F-ex-growth-find-a-b">Figure</xref>.

  		If we consider an exponential function <m>f</m> with a growth factor <m>b &gt; 1</m>, such as the function pictured in <xref ref="F-growth-incr-CCU">Figure</xref>, then the function is always increasing because higher powers of <m>b</m> are greater than lesser powers (for example, <m>(1.2)^3 \gt (1.2)^2</m>).  On the other hand, if <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>, then the exponential function will be decreasing because higher powers of positive numbers less than <m>1</m> get smaller (e.g., <m>(0.9)^3 \lt (0.9)^2</m>), as seen for the exponential function in <xref ref="F-growth-decr-CCU">Figure</xref>.   
  	</p>
          <p>
		An additional trend is apparent in the graphs in <xref ref="F-growth-incr-CCU">Figure</xref> and <xref ref="F-growth-decr-CCU">Figure</xref>.  Each graph bends upward and is therefore concave up.  We can better understand why this is so by considering the average rate of change of both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> on consecutive intervals of the same width.  We choose adjacent intervals of length <m>1</m> and note particularly that as we compute the average rate of change of each function on such intervals,
		<me>
			AV_{[t,t+1]} = \frac{f(t+1) - f(t)}{t+1-1} = f(t+1) - f(t)
		</me>.  Thus, these average rates of change are also measuring the total change in the function across an interval that is <m>1</m>-unit wide. We now assume that <m>f(t) = 2 (1.25)^t</m> and <m>g(t) = 8(0.75)^t</m> and compute the rate of change of each function on several consecutive intervals.

		From the data in <xref ref="T-growth-incr-CCU">Table</xref>, we see that the average rate of change is increasing as we increase the value of <m>t</m>.  We naturally say that <m>f</m> appears to be <q>increasing at an increasing rate</q>.  For the function <m>g</m>, we first notice that its average rate of change is always negative, but also that the average rate of change gets <em>less negative</em> as we increase the value of <m>t</m>. Said differently, the average rate of change of <m>g</m> is also increasing as we increase the value of <m>t</m>.  Since <m>g</m> is always decreasing but its average rate of change is increasing, we say that <m>g</m> appears to be <q>decreasing at an increasing rate</q>.  These trends hold for exponential functions generally<fn>It takes calculus to justify this claim fully and rigorously.</fn> according to the following conditions.
	</p>
          <assemblage xml:id="asm-growth-exponential-trends">
  		<title>Trends in exponential function behavior</title>
  		<p>
  			For an exponential function of the form <m>f(t) = ab^t</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both positive with <m>b \ne 1</m>, 
  			<ul><li>
  					<p>

  		</p>
  	</assemblage>
          <p>
  		Observe how a function's average rate of change helps us classify the function's behavior on an interval:  whether the average rate of change is always positive or always negative on the interval enables us to say if the function is always increasing or always decreasing, and then how the average rate of change itself changes enables us to potentially say <em>how</em> the function is increasing or decreasing through phrases such as <q>decreasing at an increasing rate</q>.

          <title>Summary</title>
          <ul>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				We say that a function is exponential whenever its algebraic form is <m>f(t) = ab^t</m> for some positive constants <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> where <m>b \ne 1</m>.  (Technically, the formal definition of an exponential function is one of form <m>f(t) = b^t</m>, but in our everyday usage of the term <q>exponential</q> we include vertical stretches of these functions and thus allow <m>a</m> to be any positive constant, not just <m>a = 1</m>.)
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				To determine the formula for an exponential function of form <m>f(t) = ab^t</m>, we need to know two pieces of information.  Typically this information is presented in one of two ways.
  				<ul><li>
  						<p>
  							If we know the amount, <m>a</m>, of a quantity at time <m>t = 0</m> and the rate, <m>r</m>, at which the quantity grows or decays per unit time, then it follows <m>f(t) = a(1+r)^t</m>.  In this setting, <m>r</m> is often given as a percentage that we convert to a decimal (e.g., if the quantity grows at a rate of <m>7</m>% per year, we set <m>r = 0.07</m>, so <m>b = 1.07</m>).
  						</p>
  					</li><li>
  						<p>
  							If we know any two points on the exponential function's graph, then we can set up a system of two equations in two unknowns and solve for both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> exactly.  In this situation, it is useful to consider the quotient of the two known outputs, as demonstrated in <xref ref="ex-growth-find-a-b">Example</xref>.
  						</p>
  					</li></ul>
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				Exponential functions of the form <m>f(t) = ab^t</m> (where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both positive and <m>b \ne 1</m>) exhibit the following important characteristics:
  			</p>
  			<p>
  				<ul><li>
  						<p>
  							The domain of any exponential function is the set of all real numbers and the range of any exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.
  						</p>
  					</li><li>
  						<p>
  							The <m>y</m>-intercept of the exponential function <m>f(t) = ab^t</m> is <m>(0,a)</m> and the function has no <m>x</m>-intercepts.
  						</p>
  					</li><li>
  						<p>
  							If <m>b \gt 1</m>, then the exponential function is always increasing and always increases at an increasing rate.  If <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>, then the exponential function is always decreasing and always decreases at an increasing rate.
  						</p>
  					</li></ul>
  			</p>

      <solution><alert>  SOLUTION </alert>
      
      
      
      (a) We assume that the price of a movie ticket increases at the
      rate of 3.8% per year. This means that the price is rising
      exponentially, so a formula for <m>p</m> is of the form <m>p=ab^t</m>.
      We have <m>a=9.00</m> and <m>b=1+r=1.038</m>.  Thus, a formula
      for <m>p</m> is
      <me>p = 9.00(1.038)^t.</me>
      
      
      
      
      (b) In <m>30</m> years <m>t=30</m> we have <m>p = 9.00(1.038)^{30} \approx 27.55</m>.

      The formula <m>f(t) = ab^t</m> represents exponential growth if the base <m>b &gt; 1</m> and exponential decay if <m>0 \lt  b \lt  1</m>. Towns 2, 5, 4 are growing and towns 6, 1, 3 are shrinking.
      
      
      
      Town 4  is growing the fastest since its growth factor of 1.187 is the largest.  Since 1.187 - 1 = 0.187, it is growing at a rate of 18.7%.  Town 1 is shrinking the fastest since its decay factor of 0.78 is the smallest.  Since 1 - 0.78 = 0.22, it is shrinking at a rate of 22%.
      
      
      
      In the exponential function <m>f(t) = ab^t</m>, the parameter <m>a</m> gives the value of the function when <m>t = 0</m>.  We see that town 6 has the largest initial population (2800) and town 5 has the smallest initial population (500).

      (a)
      If a function is linear, then the
      differences in successive function values will be constant. If a
      function is exponential, the ratios of successive function values will
      remain constant.
      Now
      <me>h(1) - h(0) = 8 - 14 = -6,</me>
      and
      <me>h(2) - h(1) = 2 - 8 = -6</me>
      (and similarly for the remaining intervals).
      Thus, <m>h(x)</m> is linear.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      We know that <m>h(x)</m> is linear, so
      <me>h(x) = m\,x + b</me>
      for some constants <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>.  We know that
      <m>h(0) = 14</m>, so
      <me>14 = m\cdot 0 + b = b,</me>
      and <m>b = 14</m>.  Then <m>h(1) = 8</m>, so
      <me>8 = m\cdot 1 + 14,</me>
      so <m>m = 8 - 14 = -6</m>, and we have
      <me>h(x) = -6\,x + 14.</me>
      
      
      
      
      
      (b)
      As before, if a function is linear, then the
      differences in successive function values will be constant. If a
      function is exponential, the ratios of successive function values will
      remain constant.
      Now
      <me>i(1) - i(0) = 12.6 - 14 = -1.4,</me>
      and
      <me>i(2) - i(1) = 11.34 - 12.6 = -1.26</me>
      (and similarly for the remaining intervals).
      Thus, <m>i(x)</m> is not linear.
      
      On the other hand,
      <me>\begin{aligned}
      \frac{i(1)}{i(0)} \amp = 0.9\\
      \frac{i(2)}{i(1)} \amp = 0.9
      \end{aligned}</me>
      (and similarly for the remaining intervals).
      Thus <m>i(x)</m> is exponential.
      
      
      
      
      
      We know that <m>i(x)</m> is linear, so
      <me>i(x) = a\,b^x</me>
      for some constants <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. We know that <m>i(0)=14</m>, so
      <me>\begin{aligned}
      14 \amp = i(0)\\
      14 \amp = ab^0\\
      14 \amp = a(1).
      \end{aligned}</me>
      Thus, <m>a=14</m>. Also
      <me>\begin{aligned}
      12.6 \amp = i(1)\\
      12.6 \amp = 14\,b.
      \end{aligned}</me>
      Thus <m>b = 0.9</m>, and we have
      <me>i(x) = 14\cdot 0.9^x.</me></solution>

      <solution><alert>  SOLUTION </alert>
      
      
      
      a) The population is decreasing linearly, with a slope of -125 people/year, so <m>P(t) = 8000 - 125 t</m>.
      
      
      
      b) The population is decreasing exponentially with decay factor 1 - 0.06 = 0.94, so <m>P(t) = 8000 (1- 0.06)^t=8000(0.94)^t</m></solution>

        <introduction>
          <p>
		If a quantity changes so that its growth or decay occurs at a constant percentage rate with respect to time, the function is exponential.  This is because if the growth or decay rate is <m>r</m>, the total amount of the quantity at time <m>t</m> is given by
		<m>
			A(t) = a(1+r)^t
		</m>,
		where <m>a</m> is the amount present at time <m>t = 0</m>.  Many different natural quantities change according to exponential models:  money growth through compounding interest, the growth of a population of cells, and the decay of radioactive elements.   
  	</p>
          <p>
		A related situation arises when an object's temperature changes in response to its surroundings.  For instance, if we have a cup of coffee at an initial temperature of <m>186^\circ</m> Fahrenheit and the cup is placed in a room where the surrounding temperature is <m>71^\circ</m>, our intuition and experience tell us that over time the coffee will cool and eventually tend to the <m>71^\circ</m> temperature of the surroundings.  From an experiment <fn>See <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0SB">http://gvsu.edu/s/0SB</url> for this data.</fn> with an actual temperature probe, we have the data in <xref ref="T-modeling-exp-coffee">Table</xref> that is plotted in <xref ref="F-modeling-exp-coffee">Figure</xref>.

		In one sense, the data looks exponential: the points appear to lie on a curve that is always decreasing and decreasing at an increasing rate.  However, we know that the function can't have the form <m>f(t) = ab^t</m> because such a function's range is the set of all positive real numbers, and it's impossible for the coffee's temperature to fall below room temperature (<m>71^\circ</m>).  It is natural to wonder if a function of the form <m>g(t) = ab^t + c</m> will work.  Thus, in order to find a function that fits the data in a situation such as <xref ref="F-modeling-exp-coffee">Figure</xref>, we begin by investigating and understanding the roles of <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> in the behavior of <m>g(t) = ab^t + c</m>.

          <title>Long-term behavior of exponential functions</title>
          <p>
  		We have already established that any exponential function of the form <m>f(t) = ab^t</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive real numbers with <m>b \ne 1</m> is always concave up and is either always increasing or always decreasing.  We next introduce precise language to describe the behavior of an exponential function's value as <m>t</m> gets bigger and bigger.  To start, let's consider the two basic exponential functions <m>p(t) = 2^t</m> and <m>q(t) = (\frac{1}{2})^t</m> and their respective values at <m>t = 10</m>, <m>t = 20</m>, and <m>t = 30</m>, as displayed in <xref ref="T-modeling-long-term-2t">Table</xref> and <xref ref="T-modeling-long-term-2-t">Table</xref>.

		For the increasing function <m>p(t) = 2^t</m>, we see that the output of the function gets very large very quickly.  In addition, there is no upper bound to how large the function can be.  Indeed, we can make the value of <m>p(t)</m> as large as we'd like by taking <m>t</m> sufficiently big.  We thus say that as <m>t</m> increases, <m>p(t)</m> <term>increases without bound</term>. <idx><h>increasing</h><h>without bound</h></idx> 
	</p>
          <p>
		For the decreasing function <m>q(t) = (\frac{1}{2})^t</m>, we see that the output <m>q(t)</m> is always positive but getting closer and closer to <m>0</m>.  Indeed, becasue we can make <m>2^t</m> as large as we like, it follows that we can make its reciprocal <m>\frac{1}{2^t} = (\frac{1}{2})^t</m> as small as we'd like.  We thus say that as <m>t</m> increases, <m>q(t)</m> <term>approaches <m>0</m></term>. <idx><h>approaching <m>0</m></h></idx>
	</p>
          <p>
		To represent these two common phenomena with exponential functions <dash>the value increasing without bound or the value approaching <m>0</m></dash>, we will use shorthand notation.  First, it is natural to write <q><m>q(t) \to 0</m></q> as <m>t</m> increases without bound.  Moreover, since we have the notion of the infinite to represent quantities without bound, we use the symbol for infinity and arrow notation <idx><h>infinity</h></idx> (<m>\infty</m>) and write <q><m>p(t) \to \infty</m></q> as <m>t</m> increases without bound in order to indicate that <m>p(t)</m> increases without bound.

          <p>
		In <xref ref="PA-exp-modeling">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw how the value of <m>b</m> affects the steepness of the graph of <m>f(t) = ab^t</m>, as well as how all graphs with <m>b \gt 1</m> have the similar increasing behavior, and all graphs with <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m> have similar decreasing behavior.  For instance, by taking <m>t</m> sufficiently large, we can make <m>(1.01)^t</m> as large as we want; it just takes much larger <m>t</m> to make <m>(1.01)^t</m> big in comparison to <m>2^t</m>.  In the same way, we can make <m>(0.99)^t</m> as close to <m>0</m> as we wish by taking <m>t</m> sufficiently big, even though it takes longer for <m>(0.99)^t</m> to get close to <m>0</m> in comparison to <m>(\frac{1}{2})^t</m>.  For an arbitrary choice of <m>b</m>, we can say the following.

		In addition, we make a key observation about the use of exponents.  For the function <m>q(t) = (\frac{1}{2})^t</m>, there are three equivalent ways we may write the function:
		<me>
			\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^t = \frac{1}{2^t} = 2^{-t}
		</me>.
		In our work with transformations involving horizontal scaling in <xref ref="ez-circular-sinusoidal-horiz-reflection">Exercise</xref>, we saw that the graph of <m>y = h(-t)</m> is the reflection of the graph of <m>y = h(t)</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis.  Therefore, we can say that the graphs of <m>p(t) = 2^t</m> and <m>q(t) = (\frac{1}{2})^t = 2^{-t}</m> are reflections of one another in the <m>y</m>-axis since <m>p(-t) = 2^{-t} = q(t)</m>.  We see this fact verified in <xref ref="F-modeling-exp-reflection">Figure</xref>.

          <title>The role of <m>c</m> in <m>g(t) = ab^t + c</m></title>
          <p>
  		The function <m>g(t) = ab^t + c</m> is a vertical translation of the function <m>f(t) = ab^t</m>.  We now have extensive understanding of the behavior of <m>f(t)</m> and how that behavior depends on <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.  Since a vertical translation by <m>c</m> does not change the shape of any graph, we expect that <m>g</m> will exhibit very similar behavior to <m>f</m>.  Indeed, we can compare the two functions' graphs as shown in <xref ref="F-modeling-vert-transl-0">Figure</xref> and <xref ref="F-modeling-vert-transl-c">Figure</xref> and then make the following general observations.

	</assemblage>
          <p>
		It is also possible to have <m>a \lt 0</m>.  In this situation, because <m>g(t) = ab^t</m> is both a reflection of <m>f(t) = b^t</m> across the <m>x</m>-axis and a vertical stretch by <m>|a|</m>, the function <m>g</m> is always concave down.  If <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m> so that <m>f</m> is always decreasing, then <m>g</m> is always increasing; if instead <m>b \gt 1</m> so <m>f</m> is increasing, then <m>g</m> is decreasing.  Moreover, instead of the range of the function <m>g</m> having a lower bound as when <m>a \gt 0</m>, in this setting the range of <m>g</m> has an upper bound.  These ideas are explored further in <xref ref="act-exp-modeling-behavior">Activity</xref>.

          <p>
  		It's an important skill to be able to look at an exponential function of the form <m>g(t) = ab^t + c</m> and form an accurate mental picture of the graph's main features in light of the values of <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>.

			The data in the bottom row of <xref ref="T-modeling-exp-coffee-revis">Table</xref> appears exponential, and if we test the data by computing the quotients of output values that correspond to equally-spaced input, we see a nearly constant ratio.  In particular,
			<me>
				\frac{73}{85} \approx 0.86, \ \frac{64}{73} \approx 0.88, \ \frac{56}{64} \approx 0.88, \ \frac{49}{56} \approx 0.88, \ \frac{45}{49} \approx 0.92, \text{and} \frac{40}{45} \approx 0.89 <!--, \ \frac{36}{40} = 0.9,  \frac{33}{36} \approx 0.92 -->
			</me>.
			Of course, there is some measurement error in the data (plus it is only recorded to accuracy of whole degrees), so these computations provide convincing evidence that the underlying function is exponential.  In addition, we expect that if the data continued in the bottom row of <xref ref="T-modeling-exp-coffee-revis">Table</xref>, the values would approach <m>0</m> because <m>F(t)</m> will approach <m>71</m>.

			If we choose two of the data points, say <m>(18,64)</m> and <m>(23,56)</m>, and assume that <m>f(t) = ab^t</m>, we can determine the values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.  Doing so, it turns out that <m>a \approx 103.503</m> and <m>b \approx 0.974</m>, so <m>f(t) = 103.503 ( 0.974)^t</m>.  Since <m>f(t) = F(t) - 71</m>, we see that <m>F(t) = f(t) + 71</m>, so <m>F(t) = 103.503 (0.974)^t + 71</m>.  Plotting <m>f</m> against the shifted data and <m>F</m> along with the original data in <xref ref="F-modeling-coffee-shifted">Figure</xref> and <xref ref="F-modeling-coffee-original">Figure</xref>, we see that the curves go exactly through the points where <m>t = 18</m> and <m>t = 23</m> as expected, but also that the function provides a reasonable model for the observed behavior at any time <m>t</m>.  If our data was even more accurate, we would expect that the curve's fit would be even better.

          <p>
			Our preceding work with the coffee data can be done similarly with data for any cooling or warming object whose temperature initially differs from its surroundings.  Indeed, it is possible to show that Newton's Law of Cooling implies that the object's temperature is given by a function of the form <m>F(t) = ab^t + c</m>.

          <title>Summary</title>
          <ul>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				For an exponential function of the form <m>f(t) = b^t</m>, the function either approaches zero or grows without bound as the input gets larger and larger.  In particular, if <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>, then <m>f(t) = b^t \to 0</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>, while if <m>b \gt 1</m>, then <m>f(t) = b^t \to \infty</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>.  Scaling <m>f</m> by a positive value <m>a</m> (that is, the transformed function <m>ab^t</m>) does not affect the long-range behavior:  whether the function tends to <m>0</m> or increases without bound depends solely on whether <m>b</m> is less than or greater than <m>1</m>.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				The function <m>f(t) = b^t</m> passes through <m>(0,1)</m>, is always concave up, is either always increasing or always decreasing, and its range is the set of all positive real numbers.  Among these properties, a vertical stretch by a positive value <m>a</m> only affects the <m>y</m>-intercept, which is instead <m>(0,a)</m>.  If we include a vertical shift and write <m>g(t) = ab^t + c</m>, the biggest change is that the range of <m>g</m> is the set of all real numbers greater than <m>c</m>.  In addition, the <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>g</m> is <m>(0,a+c)</m>.
  			</p>

  			<p>
  				In the situation where <m>a \lt 0</m>, several other changes are induced.  Here, because <m>g(t) = ab^t</m> is both a reflection of <m>f(t) = b^t</m> across the <m>x</m>-axis and a vertical stretch by <m>|a|</m>, the function <m>g</m> is now always concave down.  If <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m> so that <m>f</m> is always decreasing, then <m>g</m> (the reflected function) is now always increasing; if instead <m>b \gt 1</m> so <m>f</m> is increasing, then <m>g</m> is decreasing.  Finally, if <m>a \lt 0</m>, then the range of <m>g(t) = ab^t + c</m> is the set of all real numbers <m>c</m>.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				An exponential function can be thought of as a function that changes at a rate proportional to itself, like how money grows with compound interest or the amount of a radioactive quantity decays.  Newton's Law of Cooling says that the rate of change of an object's temperature is proportional to the <em>difference</em> between its own temperature and the temperature of its surroundings.  This leads to the function that measures the difference between the object's temperature and room temperature being exponential, and hence the object's temperature itself is a vertically-shifted exponential function of the form <m>F(t) = ab^t + c</m>.

        A cup of coffee has its temperature, <m>C(t)</m>, measured in degrees Celsius.  When poured outdoors on a cold morning, its temperature is <m>C(0) = 95</m>.  Ten minutes later, <m>C(10) = 80</m>.

        <title>The special number <m>e</m></title>
        <objectives>
  	<ul><li>
  			<p>
  				Why can every exponential function of form <m>f(t) = b^t</m> (where <m>b \gt 0</m> and <m>b \ne 1</m>) be thought of as a horizontal scaling of a single special exponential function?

  			<p>
  				What is the natural base <m>e</m> and what makes this number special?
  			</p>
  		</li></ul>
  </objectives>
        <introduction>
          <p>
  		We have observed that the behavior of functions of the form <m>f(t) = b^t</m> is very consistent, where the only major differences depend on whether <m>b \lt 1</m> or <m>b \gt 1</m>.  Indeed, if we stipulate that <m>b \gt 1</m>, the graphs of functions with different bases <m>b</m> look nearly identical, as seen in the plots of <m>p</m>, <m>q</m>, <m>r</m>, and <m>s</m> in <xref ref="F-e-4-b-t">Figure</xref>.
  	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-e-4-b-t">
            <caption>Plots of four different exponential functions of form <m>b^t</m> with <m>b \gt 1</m>.</caption>
            <image source="images/e-base-compression" width="50%"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
		Because the point <m>(0,1)</m> lies on the graph of each of the four functions in <xref ref="F-e-4-b-t">Figure</xref>, the functions cannot be vertical scalings of one another.  However, it is possible that the functions are <em>horizontal</em> scalings of one another.  This leads us to a natural question:  might it be possible to find a single exponential function with a special base, say <m>e</m>, for which every other exponential function <m>f(t) = b^t</m> can be expressed as a horizontal scaling of <m>E(t) = e^t</m>?

          <title>The natural base <m>e</m></title>
          <p>
  		In <xref ref="PA-exp-e">Preview Activity</xref>, we found that it appears possible to find a value of <m>k</m> so that given any base <m>b</m>, we can write the function <m>b^t</m> as the horizontal scaling of <m>2^t</m> given by
  		<me>
  			b^t = 2^{kt}
  		</me>.
  		It's also apparent that there's nothing particularly special about <q><m>2</m></q>: we could similarly write any function <m>b^t</m> as a horizontal scaling of <m>3^t</m> or <m>4^t</m>, albeit with a different scaling factor <m>k</m> for each.  Thus, we might also ask:  is there a <em>best</em> possible single base to use?
  	</p>
          <p>
  		Through the central topic of the <em>rate of change</em> of a function, calculus helps us decide which base is best to use to represent all exponential functions.  While we study <em>average</em> rate of change extensively in this course, in calculus there is more emphasis on the <em>instantaneous</em> rate of change.  In that context, a natural question arises: is there a nonzero function that grows in such a way that its <em>height</em> is exactly how <em>fast</em> its height is increasing?
  	</p>
          <p>
  		Amazingly, it turns out that the answer to this questions is <q>yes,</q> and the function with this property is
    	<term>the exponential function with the natural base</term>, denoted <m>e^t</m>. The number <m>e</m> (named in homage to the great Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler (1707-1783)) is complicated to define.  Like <m>\pi</m>, <m>e</m> is an irrational number that cannot be represented exactly by a ratio of integers and whose decimal expansion never repeats.  Advanced mathematics is needed in order to make the following formal definition of <m>e</m>.

		For instance, <m>1 + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} + \frac{1}{120} = \frac{163}{60} \approx 2.7167</m> is an approximation of <m>e</m> generated by taking the first <m>6</m> terms in the infinite sum that defines it.  Every computational device knows the number <m>e</m> and we will normally work with this number by using technology appropriately.  
	</p>
          <p>
	 	Initially, it's important to note that <m>2 \lt e \lt 3</m>, and thus we expect the function <m>e^t</m> to lie between <m>2^t</m> and <m>3^t</m>.

		If we compare the graphs and some selected outputs of each function, as in <xref ref="T-e-2-e-3">Table</xref> and <xref ref="F-e-2-e-3">Figure</xref>, we see that the function <m>e^t</m> satisfies the inequality 
		<me>
			2^t \lt e^t \lt 3^t
		</me>
		for all positive values of <m>t</m>.  When <m>t</m> is negative, we can view the values of each function as being reciprocals of powers of <m>2</m>, <m>e</m>, and <m>3</m>.  For instance, since <m>2^2 \lt e^2 \lt 3^2</m>, it follows <m>\frac{1}{3^2} \lt \frac{1}{e^2} \lt \frac{1}{2^2}</m>, or 
		<me>
			3^{-2} \lt e^{-2} \lt 2^{-2}
		</me>.  Thus, for any <m>t \lt 0</m>,
		<me>
			3^t \lt e^t \lt 2^t
		</me>
		Like <m>2^t</m> and <m>3^t</m>, the function <m>e^t</m> passes through <m>(0,1)</m> is always increasing and always concave up, and its range is the set of all positive real numbers.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-exp-e-inverse">
          <title>Why any exponential function can be written in terms of <m>e</m></title>
          <p>
		In <xref ref="PA-exp-e">Preview Activity</xref>, we saw graphical evidence that any exponential function <m>f(t) = b^t</m> can be written as a horizontal scaling of the function <m>g(t) = 2^t</m>, plus we observed that there wasn't anything particularly special about <m>2^t</m>.    Because of the importance of <m>e^t</m> in calculus, we will choose instead to use the natural exponential function, 	<m>E(t) = e^t</m> as the function we scale to generate any other exponential function <m>f(t) = b^t</m>.  We claim that for any choice of <m>b \gt 0</m> (with <m>b \ne 1</m>), there exists a horizontal scaling factor <m>k</m> such that <m>b^t = f(t) = E(kt) = e^{kt}</m>.
	</p>
          <p>
		By the rules of exponents, we can rewrite this last equation equivalently as
		<me>
			b^t = (e^k)^t
		</me>.
		Since this equation has to hold for every value of <m>t</m>, it follows that <m>b = e^k</m>.  Thus, our claim that we can scale <m>E(t)</m> to get <m>f(t)</m> requires us to show that regardless of the choice of the positive number <m>b</m>, there exists a single corresponding value of <m>k</m> such that <m>b = e^k</m>.
	</p>
          <p>
	    Given <m>b \gt 0</m>, we can always find a corresponding value of <m>k</m> such that <m>e^k = b</m> because the function <m>f(t) = e^t</m> passes the <xref ref="asm-inverse-H-L-test" text="title"/>, as seen in <xref ref="F-e-b-k">Figure</xref>.
	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-e-b-k">
            <caption>A plot of <m>f(t) = e^t</m> along with several choices of positive constants <m>b</m> viewed on the vertical axis.</caption>
            <image source="images/e-b-k" width="50%"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
		In <xref ref="F-e-b-k">Figure</xref>, we can think of <m>b</m> as a point on the positive vertical axis.  From there, we draw a horizontal line over to the graph of <m>f(t) = e^t</m>, and then from the (unique) point of intersection we drop a vertical line to the <m>x</m>-axis.  At that corresponding point on the <m>x</m>-axis we have found the input value <m>k</m> that corresponds to <m>b</m>.  We see that there is always exactly one such <m>k</m> value that corresponds to each chosen <m>b</m> because <m>f(t) = e^t</m> is always increasing, and any always increasing function passes the Horizontal Line Test.
	</p>
          <p>
		It follows that the function <m>f(t) = e^t</m> has an inverse function, and hence there must be some other function <m>g</m> such that writing <m>y = f(t)</m> is the same as writing <m>t = g(y)</m>.  This important function <m>g</m> will be developed in <xref ref="sec-exp-log">Section</xref> and will enable us to find the value of <m>k</m> exactly for a given <m>b</m>.  For now, we are content to work with these observations graphically and to hence find estimates for the value of <m>k</m>.

  				Any exponential function <m>f(t) = b^t</m> can be viewed as a horizontal scaling of <m>E(t) = e^t</m> because there exists a unique constant <m>k</m> such that <m>E(kt) = e^{kt} = b^t = f(t)</m> is true for every value of <m>t</m>.  This holds since the exponential function <m>e^t</m> is always increasing, so given an output <m>b</m> there exists a unique input <m>k</m> such that <m>e^k = b</m>, from which it follows that <m>e^{kt} = b^t</m>.

  				The natural base <m>e</m> is the special number that defines an increasing exponential function whose rate of change at any point is the same as its height at that point, a fact that is established using calculus.

        When a single investment of principal, $<m>P</m>, is invested in an account that returns interest at an annual rate of <m>r</m> (a decimal that corresponds to the percentage rate, such as <m>r = 0.05</m> corresponding to <m>5</m>%) that is compounded <m>n</m> times per year, the amount of money in the account after <m>t</m> years is given by <m>A(t) = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}</m>.

        <introduction>
          <p>
  		In <xref ref="sec-changing-inverse">Section</xref>, we introduced the idea of an inverse function.  The fundamental idea is that <m>f</m> has an inverse function if and only if there exists another function <m>g</m> such that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> <q>undo</q> one another's respective processes.  In other words, the process of the function <m>f</m> is reversible, and reversing <m>f</m> generates a related function <m>g</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>	
  		More formally, recall that a function <m>y = f(x)</m> (where <m>f : A \to B</m>) has an inverse function if and only if there exists another function <m>g : B \to A</m> such that <m>g(f(x)) = x</m> for every <m>x</m> in <m>A</m>, and <m>f(g(y)) = y</m> for every <m>y</m> in <m>B</m>.    We know that given a function <m>f</m>, we can use the <xref ref="asm-inverse-H-L-test" text="title"/> to determine whether or not <m>f</m> has an inverse function.  Finally, whenever a function <m>f</m> has an inverse function, we call its inverse function <m>f^{-1}</m> and know that the two equations <m>y = f(x)</m> and <m>x = f^{-1}(y)</m> say the same thing from different perspectives.

          <title>The base-<m>10</m> logarithm</title>
          <p>
		The powers-of-<m>10</m> function <m>P(t) = 10^t</m> is an exponential function with base <m>b \gt 1</m>.  As such, <m>P</m> is always increasing, and thus its graph passes the <xref ref="asm-inverse-H-L-test" text="title"/>, so <m>P</m> has an inverse function.  We therefore know there exists some other function, <m>L</m>, such that writing <m>y = P(t)</m> is equivalent to writing <m>t = L(y)</m>.  For instance, we know that <m>P(2)=100</m> and <m>P(-3)=\frac{1}{1000}</m>, so it's equivalent to say that <m>L(100) = 2</m> and <m>L(\frac{1}{1000}) = -3</m>.  This new function <m>L</m> we call the <em>base <m>10</m> logarithm</em>, which is formally defined as follows.
	</p>
          <definition xml:id="D-log-base-10">
            <idx>
              <h>logarithm</h>
              <h>base <m>10</m></h>
              <h>definition</h>
            </idx>
            <statement>
              <p>
        Given a positive real number <m>y</m>, the <term>base-<m>10</m> logarithm of <m>y</m></term> is the power to which we raise <m>10</m> to get <m>y</m>.  We use the notation <q><m>\log_{10}(y)</m></q> to denote the base-<m>10</m> logarithm of <m>y</m>.   
      </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
		The base-<m>10</m> logarithm is therefore the inverse of the powers of <m>10</m> function.  Whereas <m>P(t) = 10^t</m> takes an input whose value is an exponent and produces the result of taking <m>10</m> to that power, the base-<m>10</m> logarithm takes an input number we view as a power of <m>10</m> and produces the corresponding exponent such that <m>10</m> to that exponent is the input number.  
	</p>
          <p>
		In the notation of logarithms, we can now update our earlier observations with the functions <m>P</m> and <m>L</m> and see how exponential equations can be written in two equivalent ways.  For instance, 
		<men xml:id="eq-exp-log-base-10-2">
			10^2 = 100 \text{ and } \log_{10}(100) = 2
		</men>
		each say the same thing from two different perspectives.  The first says <q><m>100</m> is <m>10</m> to the power <m>2</m></q>, while the second says <q><m>2</m> is the power to which we raise <m>10</m> to get <m>100</m></q>.  Similarly, 
		<men xml:id="eq-exp-log-base-10-minus-3">
			10^{-3} = \frac{1}{1000} \text{ and } \log_{10} \left( \frac{1}{1000} \right) = -3
		</men>.
	</p>
          <p>
		If we rearrange the statements of the facts in <xref ref="eq-exp-log-base-10-2">Equation</xref>, we can see yet another important relationship between the powers of <m>10</m> and base-<m>10</m> logarithm function.  Noting that <m>\log_{10}(100) = 2</m> and <m>100 = 10^2</m> are equivalent statements, and substituting the latter equation into the former, we see that
		<men xml:id="eq-exp-log-base-10-2-undo">
			\log_{10}(10^2) = 2
		</men>.
		In words, <xref ref="eq-exp-log-base-10-2-undo">Equation</xref> says that <q>the power to which we raise <m>10</m> to get <m>10^2</m>, is <m>2</m></q>.  That is, the base-<m>10</m> logarithm function undoes the work of the powers of <m>10</m> function. 
	</p>
          <p>
		In a similar way, if we rearrange the statements in <xref ref="eq-exp-log-base-10-minus-3">Equation</xref>, we can observe that by replacing <m>-3</m> with <m>\log_{10}(\frac{1}{1000})</m> we have
		<men xml:id="eq-exp-log-base-10-minus-3-undo">
			10^{\log_{10}(\frac{1}{1000})} = \frac{1}{1000}
		</men>.
		In words, <xref ref="eq-exp-log-base-10-minus-3-undo">Equation</xref> says that <q>when <m>10</m> is raised to the power to which we raise <m>10</m> in order to get <m>\frac{1}{1000}</m>, we get <m>\frac{1}{1000}</m></q>.
	</p>
          <p>
		We summarize the key relationships between the powers-of-<m>10</m> function and its inverse, the base-<m>10</m> logarithm function, more generally as follows.

          <assemblage xml:id="asm-exp-log-base-10">

          <p>
		The base-<m>10</m> logarithm function is like the sine or cosine function in this way:  for certain special values, it's easy to know the value of the logarithm function.  While for sine and cosine the familiar points come from specially placed points on the unit circle, for the base-<m>10</m> logarithm function, the familiar points come from powers of <m>10</m>.
		In addition, like sine and cosine, for all other input values, (a) calculus ultimately determines the value of the base-<m>10</m> logarithm function at other values, and (b) we use computational technology in order to compute these values.  For most computational devices, the command <c>log(y)</c> produces the result of the base-<m>10</m> logarithm of <m>y</m>.
	</p>
          <p>
		It's important to note that the logarithm function produces exact values.  For instance, if we want to solve the equation <m>10^t = 5</m>, then it follows that <m>t = \log_{10}(5)</m> is the exact solution to the equation.  Like <m>\sqrt{2}</m> or <m>\cos(1)</m>, <m>\log_{10}(5)</m> is a number that is an exact value.  A computational device can give us a decimal approximation, and we normally want to distinguish between the exact value and the approximate one.  For the three different numbers here, <m>\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414</m>, <m>\cos(1) \approx 0.540</m>, and <m>\log_{10}(5) \approx 0.699</m>.

          <title>The natural logarithm</title>
          <p>
  		The base-<m>10</m> logarithm is a good starting point for understanding how logarithmic functions work because powers of <m>10</m> are easy to mentally compute.  We could similarly consider the powers of <m>2</m> or powers of <m>3</m> function and develop a corresponding logarithm of base <m>2</m> or <m>3</m>.  But rather than have a whole collection of different logarithm functions, in the same way that we now use the function <m>e^t</m> and appropriate scaling to represent any exponential function, we develop a single logarithm function that we can use to represent any other logarithmic function through scaling.  In correspondence with the natural exponential function, <m>e^t</m>, we now develop its inverse function, and call this inverse function the <term>natural logarithm</term>.

          <example xml:id="ex-log-find-k">
            <statement>
              <p>
  				Determine the exact value of <m>k</m> for which <m>f(t) = 3^t = e^{kt}</m>.

              <p>
  				<em>Solution</em>.  Since we want <m>3^t = e^{kt}</m> to hold for every value of <m>t</m> and <m>e^{kt} = (e^k)^t</m>, we need to have <m>3^t = (e^k)^t</m>, and thus <m>3 = e^k</m>.  Therefore, <m>k</m> is the power to which we raise <m>e</m> to get <m>3</m>, which by definition means that <m>k = \ln(3)</m>.

  		In modeling important phenomena using exponential functions, we will frequently encounter equations where the variable is in the exponent, like in <xref ref="ex-log-find-k">Example</xref> where we had to solve <m>e^k = 3</m>.  It is in this context where logarithms find one of their most powerful applications.  <xref ref="act-exp-log-equations">Activity</xref> provides some opportunities to practice solving equations involving the natural base, <m>e</m>, and the natural logarithm.

  				The base-<m>10</m> logarithm of <m>y</m>, denoted <m>\log_{10}(y)</m>, is defined to be the power to which we raise <m>10</m>  to get <m>y</m>.  For instance, <m>\log_{10}(1000) = 3</m>, since <m>10^3 = 1000</m>.  The function <m>L(y) = \log_{10}(y)</m> is thus the inverse of the powers-of-<m>10</m> function, <m>P(t) = 10^t</m>.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				The natural logarithm <m>N(y) = \ln(y)</m>  differs from the base-<m>10</m> logarithm in that it is the logarithm with base <m>e</m> instead of <m>10</m>, and thus <m>\ln(y)</m> is the power to which we raise <m>e</m> to get <m>y</m>.  The function <m>N(y) = \ln(y)</m> is the inverse of the natural exponential function <m>E(t) = e^t</m>.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				The natural logarithm often enables us solve an equation that involves <m>e</m> to some unknown quantity.  For instance, to solve <m>2e^{3t-4} + 5 = 13</m>, we can first solve for <m>e^{3t-4}</m> by subtracting <m>5</m> from each side and dividing by <m>2</m> to get
  				<me>
  					e^{3t-4} = 4
  				</me>.
  				This last equation says <q><m>e</m> to some power is <m>4</m></q>.  We know that it is equivalent to say 
  				<me>
  					\ln(4) = 3t-4
  				</me>.
  				Since <m>\ln(4)</m> is a number, we can solve this most recent linear equation for <m>t</m>.  In particular, <m>3t = 4 + \ln(4)</m>, so
  				<me>
  					t = \frac{1}{3}(4 + \ln(4))
  				</me>.

              <p>
        Recall that when a function <m>y = f(x)</m> has an inverse function, the two equations <m>y = f(x)</m> and <m>x = f^{-1}(y)</m> say the same thing from different perspectives: the first equation expresses <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>, while the second expresses <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m>.  When <m>y = f(x) = e^x</m>, we know its inverse is <m>x = f^{-1}(y) = \ln(y)</m>.  Through logarithms, we now have the ability to find the inverse of many different exponential functions.  In particular, because exponential functions and their transformations are either always increasing or always decreasing, any function of the form <m>y = f(x) = ae^{-kx} + c</m> will have an inverse function.
      </p>

        Find the inverse function for each given function by solving algebraically for <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>.  In addition, state the domain and range of the given function and the domain and range of of the inverse function.

              <p>
        We've seen that any exponential function <m>f(t) = b^t</m> (<m>b \gt 0</m>, <m>b \ne 1</m>) can be written in the form <m>f(t) = e^{kt}</m> for some real number <m>k</m>, and this is because <m>f(t) = b^t</m> is a horizontal scaling of the function <m>E(t) = e^{t}</m>.  In this exercise, we explore how the natural logarithm can be scaled to achieve a logarithm of any base.
      </p>
              <p>
        Let <m>b \gt 1</m>.  Because the function <m>y = f(t) = b^t</m> has an inverse function, it makes sense to define its inverse like we did when <m>b = 10</m> or <m>b = e</m>.  The <term>base-<m>b</m> logarithm</term>, <idx><h>logarithm</h><h>base-<m>b</m></h><h>definition</h></idx> denoted <m>\log_b(y)</m> is defined to be the power to which we raise <m>b</m> to get <m>y</m>.  Thus, writing <m>y = f(t) = b^t</m> is the same as writing <m>t = f^{-1}(y) = \log_b(y)</m>.

          <p>
  		Logarithms arise as inverses of exponential functions.  In addition, we have motivated their development by our desire to solve exponential equations such as <m>e^k = 3</m> for <m>k</m>.  Because of the inverse relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions, there are several important properties logarithms have that are analogous to ones held by exponential functions.  We will work to develop these properties and then show how they are useful in applied settings.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-exp-log-key-properties">
          <title>Key properties of logarithms</title>
          <p>
  		In <xref ref="PA-exp-log-properties">Preview Activity</xref>, we considered an argument for why <m>\log_{10}(ab) = \log_{10}(a) + \log_{10}(b)</m> for any choice of positive numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.  In what follows, we develop this and other properties of the natural logarithm function; similar reasoning shows the same properties hold for logarithms of any base.
	</p>
          <p>
		Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be any positive real numbers so that <m>x = \ln(a)</m> and <m>y = \ln(b)</m> are both defined.  Observe that we can rewrite these two equations using the definition of the natural logarithm so that
		<me>
			a = e^x \ \text{ and } \ b = e^y
		</me>.
		Using substitution, we can now say that
		<me>
			\ln(a \cdot b) = \ln(e^x \cdot e^y)
		</me>.
		By exponent rules, we know that <m>\ln(e^x \cdot e^y) = \ln(e^{x+y})</m>, and because the natural logarithm and natural exponential function are inverses, <m>\ln(e^{x+y}) = x+y</m>.  Combining the three most recent equations,
		<me>
			\ln(a \cdot b) = x + y
		</me>.
		Finally, recalling that <m>x = \ln(a)</m> and <m>y = \ln(b)</m>, we have shown that
		<me>
			\ln(a \cdot b) = \ln(a) + \ln(b)
		</me>
		for any choice of positive real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		A similar property holds for <m>\ln(\frac{a}{b})</m>.  By nearly the same argument, we can say that
  		<md><mrow>\ln\left( \frac{a}{b} \right) &amp;= \ln\left( \frac{e^x}{e^y} \right)</mrow><mrow> 		&amp;= \ln \left( e^{x-y} \right)</mrow><mrow> 		&amp;= x-y</mrow><mrow> 		&amp;= \ln(a) - \ln(b)</mrow></md>.
  	</p>
          <p>
		We have thus shown the following general principles.
	</p>
          <assemblage xml:id="asm-log-properties-prod-quot">
		<title>Logarithms of products and quotients</title>
		<idx><h>logarithm</h><h>of a product</h></idx>
		<idx><h>logarithm</h><h>of a quotient</h></idx>
		<p>
			For any positive real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
			<ul><li>
					<m>
						\ln(a \cdot b) = \ln(a) + \ln(b)
					</m>
				</li><li>
					<m>
						\ln\left( \frac{a}{b} \right) = \ln(a) - \ln(b)
					</m>
				</li></ul>
		</p>
	</assemblage>
          <p>
		Because positive integer exponents are a shorthand way to express repeated multiplication, we can use the multiplication rule for logarithms to think about exponents as well.  For example,
		<me>
			\ln(a^3) = \ln(a \cdot a \cdot a)
		</me>,
		and by repeated application of the rule for the natural logarithm of a product, we see
		<me>
			\ln(a^3) = \ln(a) + \ln(a) + \ln(a) = 3\ln(a)
		</me>.
		A similar argument works to show that for every natural number <m>n</m>,
		<me>
			\ln(a^n) = n\ln(a)
		</me>.  
		More sophisticated mathematics can be used to prove that the following property holds for every real number exponent <m>t</m>. 
	</p>
          <assemblage xml:id="asm-log-properties-exponents">
		<title>Logarithms of exponential expressions</title>
		<p>
			For any positive real number <m>a</m> and any real number <m>t</m>,
			<me>
				\ln(a^t) = t\ln(a)
			</me>.
		</p>
	</assemblage>
          <p>
		The rule that <m>\ln(a^t) = t\ln(a)</m> is extremely powerful:  by working with logarithms appropriately, it enables us to move from having a variable in an exponential expression to the variable being part of a linear expression.  Moreover, it enables us to solve exponential equations exactly, regardless of the base involved.
	</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-log-properties-solve-eqn">
            <statement>
              <p>
				Solve the equation <m>7 \cdot 3^t - 1 = 5</m> exactly for <m>t</m>.
			</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
				To solve for <m>t</m>, we first solve for <m>3^t</m>.  Adding <m>1</m> to both sides and dividing by <m>7</m>, we find that
				<m>
					3^t = \frac{6}{7}
				</m>.
				Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation.  Doing so, we have
				<me>
					\ln \left( 3^t \right) =  \ln \left( \frac{6}{7} \right)
				</me>.
				Applying the rule for the logarithm of an exponential expression on the left, we see that
				<m>
					t \ln(3) = \ln \left( \frac{6}{7} \right)
				</m>.
				Both <m>\ln(3)</m> and <m>\ln \left( \frac{6}{7} \right)</m> are simply numbers, and thus we conclude that
				<me>
					t = \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln \left( \frac{6}{7} \right)}
				</me>.
			</p>
            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
		The approach used in <xref ref="ex-log-properties-solve-eqn">Example</xref> works in a wide range of settings:  any time we have an exponential equation of the form <m>p \cdot q^t + r = s</m>, we can solve for <m>t</m> by first isolating the exponential expression <m>q^t</m> and then by taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation.

          <title>The graph of the natural logarithm</title>
          <p>
  		As the inverse of the natural exponential function <m>E(x) = e^x</m>, we have already established that the natural logarithm <m>N(x) = \ln(x)</m> has the set of all positive real numbers as its domain and the set of all real numbers as its range.  In addition, being the inverse of <m>E(x) = e^x</m>, we know that when we plot the natural logarithm and natural exponential functions on the same coordinate axes, their graphs are reflections of one another across the line <m>y = x</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-log-natural-graph-1">Figure</xref> and <xref ref="F-log-natural-graph-2">Figure</xref>.
  	</p>
          <sidebyside>
            <figure xml:id="F-log-natural-graph-1">
              <caption>The natural exponential and natural logarithm functions on the interval <m>[-3,3]</m>.</caption>
              <image source="images/log-graph-1"/>
            </figure>
            <figure xml:id="F-log-natural-graph-2">
              <caption>The natural exponential and natural logarithm functions on the interval <m>[-15,15]</m>.</caption>
              <image source="images/log-graph-2"/>
            </figure>
          </sidebyside>
          <p>
  		Indeed, for any point <m>(a,b)</m> that lies on the graph of <m>E(x) = e^x</m>, it follows that the point <m>(b,a)</m> lies on the graph of the inverse <m>N(x) = \ln(x)</m>.  From this, we see several important properties of the graph of the logarithm function.
  	</p>
          <assemblage>
  		<title>The graph of <m>y = \ln(x)</m></title>
  		<p>
  			The graph of <m>y = \ln(x)</m>
  			<ul><li>
  					<p>
  						passes through the point <m>(1,0)</m>;
  					</p>
  				</li><li>
  					<p>
  						is always increasing;
  					</p>
  				</li><li>
  					<p>
  						is always concave down; and
  					</p>
  				</li><li>
					<p>
						increases without bound.
					</p>
				</li></ul>
  		</p>
  	</assemblage>
          <p>
  		Because the graph of <m>E(x) = e^x</m> increases more and more rapidly as <m>x</m> increases, the graph of <m>N(x) = \ln(x)</m> increases more and more slowly as <m>x</m> increases.  Even though the natural logarithm function grows very slowly, it does grow without bound because we can make <m>\ln(x)</m> as large as we want by making <m>x</m> sufficiently large.  For instance, if we want <m>x</m> such that <m>\ln(x) = 100</m>, we choose <m>x = e^{100}</m>, since <m>\ln(e^{100}) = 100</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		While the natural exponential function and the natural logarithm (and transformations of these functions) are connected and have certain similar properties, it's also important to be able to distinguish between behavior that is fundamentally exponential and fundamentally logarithmic.

          <title>Putting logarithms to work</title>
          <p>
  		We've seen in several different settings that the function <m>e^{kt}</m> plays a key role in modeling phenomena in the world around us.  We also understand that the value of <m>k</m> controls whether <m>e^{kt}</m> is increasing (<m>k \gt 0</m>) or decreasing (<m>k \lt 0</m>) and how fast the function is increasing or decreasing.  As such, we often need to determine the value of <m>k</m> from data that is presented to us; doing so almost always requires the use of logarithms.
  	</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-log-pop-find-k">
            <statement>
              <p>
  				A population of bacteria cells is growing at a rate proportionate to the number of cells present at a given time <m>t</m> (in hours).  Suppose that the number of cells, <m>P</m>, in the population is measured in millions of cells and we know that <m>P(0) = 2.475</m> and <m>P(10) = 4.298</m>.  Find a model of the form <m>P(t) = Ae^{kt}</m> that fits this data and use it to determine the value of <m>k</m> and how long it will take for the population to reach <m>1</m> billion cells.
  			</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
  				Since the model has form <m>P(t) = Ae^{kt}</m>, we know that <m>P(0) = A</m>.  Because we are given that <m>P(0) = 2.475</m>, this shows that <m>A = 2.475</m>.  To find <m>k</m>, we use the fact that <m>P(10) = 4.298</m>.  Applying this information, <m>A = 2.475</m>, and the form of the model, <m>P(t) = Ae^{kt}</m>, we see that
	  			<me>
	  				4.298 = 2.475 e^{k \cdot 10}
	  			</me>.
  				To solve for <m>k</m>, we first isolate <m>e^{10k}</m> by dividing both sides by <m>2.475</m> to get 
  				<me>
  					e^{10k} = \frac{4.298}{2.475} 
  				</me>.
  				Taking the natural logarithm of each side, we find
  				<me>
  					10k = \ln \left( \frac{4.298}{2.475} \right)
  				</me>,
  				and thus <m>k = \frac{1}{10}\ln \left( \frac{4.298}{2.475} \right) \approx 0.05519</m>.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				To determine how long it takes for the population to reach <m>1</m> billion cells, we need to solve the equation <m>P(t) = 1000</m>.  Using our preceding work to find <m>A</m> and <m>k</m>, we know that we need to solve the equation
  				<me>
  					1000 = 2.475 e^{\frac{1}{10}\ln \left( \frac{4.298}{2.475} \right)t}
  				</me>.
  				We divide both sides by <m>2.475</m> to get <m>e^{\frac{1}{10}\ln \left( \frac{4.298}{2.475} \right)t} = \frac{1000}{2.475}</m>, and after taking the natural logarithm of each side, we see
  				<me>
  					\frac{1}{10}\ln \left( \frac{4.298}{2.475} \right)t = \ln \left( \frac{1000}{2.475} \right)
  				</me>,
  				so that
  				<me>
  					t = \frac{10 \ln \left( \frac{1000}{2.475} \right)}{\ln \left( \frac{4.298}{2.475} \right)} \approx 108.741

  				What roles do the parameters <m>a</m>, <m>k</m>, and <m>c</m> play in how the function <m>F(t) = c + ae^{-kt}</m> models the temperature of an object that is cooling or warming in its surroundings?

  			<p>
  				How can we use an exponential function to more realistically model a population whose growth levels off?
  			</p>
  		</li></ul>
  </objectives>
        <introduction>
          <p>
		We've seen that exponential functions can be used to model several different important phenomena, such as the growth of money due to continuously compounded interest, the decay of radioactive quanitities, and the temperature of an object that is cooling or warming due to its surroundings.  From initial work with functions of the form <m>f(t) = ab^t</m> where <m>b \gt 0</m> and <m>b \ne 1</m>, we found that shifted exponential functions of form <m>g(t) = ab^t + c</m> are also important.  Moreover, the special base <m>e</m> allows us to represent all of these functions through horizontal scaling by writing
		<men xml:id="eq-temp-pop-gen-exp-model">
			g(t) = ae^{kt} + c
		</men>
		where <m>k</m> is the constant such that <m>e^k = b</m>.
		Functions of the form of <xref ref="eq-temp-pop-gen-exp-model">Equation</xref> are either always increasing or always decreasing, always have the same concavity, are defined on the set of all real numbers, and have their range as the set of all real numbers greater than <m>c</m> or all real numbers less than <m>c</m>.  In whatever setting we are using a model of this form, the crucial task is to identify the values of <m>a</m>, <m>k</m>, and <m>c</m>; that endeavor is the focus of this section.
	</p>
          <p>
		We have also begun to see the important role that logarithms play in work with exponential models.  The natural logarithm is the inverse of the natural exponential function and satisfies the important rule that <m>\ln(b^k) = k\ln (b)</m>.  This rule enables us to solve equations with the structure <m>a^k = b</m> for <m>k</m> in the context where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are known but <m>k</m> is not.  Indeed, we can first take the natural log of both sides of the equation to get
		<me>
			\ln(a^k) = \ln(b)
		</me>,
		from which it follows that <m>k \ln(a) = \ln(b)</m>, and therefore
		<me>
			k = \frac{\ln(b)}{\ln(a)}
		</me>.
		Finding <m>k</m> is often central to determining an exponential model, and logarithms make finding the exact value of <m>k</m> possible.
	</p>
          <p>
		In <xref ref="PA-exp-temp-pop">Preview Activity</xref>, we revisit some key algebraic ideas with exponential and logarithmic equations in preparation for using these concepts in models for temperature and population.

          <title>Newton's Law of Cooling revisited</title>
          <p>
  		In <xref ref="sec-exp-modeling">Section</xref>, we learned that Newton's Law of Cooling, which states that an object's temperature changes at a rate proportional to the difference between its own temperature and the surrounding temperature, results in the object's temperature being modeled by functions of the form <m>F(t) = ab^t + c</m>.  In light of our subsequent work in <xref ref="sec-exp-e">Section</xref> with the natural base <m>e</m>, as well as the fact that <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m> in this model, we know that Newton's Law of Cooling implies that the object's temperature is modeled by a function of the form
  		<men xml:id="eq-temp-pop-NLOC">
  			F(t) = ae^{-kt} + c
  		</men>
  		for some constants <m>a</m>, <m>c</m>, and <m>k</m>, where <m>k \gt 0</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		From <xref ref="eq-temp-pop-NLOC">Equation</xref>, we can determine several different characteristics of how the constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>k</m> are connected to the behavior of <m>F</m> by thinking about what happens at <m>t = 0</m>, at one additional value of <m>t</m>, and as <m>t</m> increases without bound.  In particular, note that <m>e^{-kt}</m> will tend to <m>0</m> as <m>t</m> increases without bound.
  	</p>
          <assemblage>
  		<title>Modeling temperature with Newton's Law of Cooling</title>
  		<p>
  			For the function <m>F(t) = ae^{-kt} + c</m> that models the temperature of a cooling or warming object, the constants <m>a</m>, <m>c</m>, and <m>k</m> play the following roles.
  			<ul><li>
  					<p>
  						Since <m>e^{-kt}</m> tends to <m>0</m> as <m>t</m> increases without bound, <m>F(t)</m> tends to <m>c</m> as <m>t</m> increases without bound, and thus <m>c</m> represents the temperature of the object's surroundings.
  					</p>
  				</li><li>
  					<p>
  						Since <m>e^0 = 1</m>, <m>F(0) = a + c</m>, and thus the object's initial temperature is <m>a + c</m>.  Said differently, <m>a</m> is the difference between the object's initial temperature and the temperature of the surroundings.
  					</p>
  				</li><li>
  					<p>
  						Once we know the values of <m>a</m> and <m>c</m>, the value of <m>k</m> is determined by knowing the value of the temperature function <m>F(t)</m> at one nonzero value of <m>t</m>.

          <title>A more realistic model for population growth</title>
          <p>
  		If we assume that a population grows at a rate that is proportionate to the size of the population, it follows that the population grows exponentially according to the model
  		<me>
  			P(t) = Ae^{kt}
  		</me>
  		where <m>A</m> is the initial population and <m>k</m> is tied to the rate at which the population grows.  Since <m>k \gt 0</m>, we know that <m>e^{kt}</m> is an always increasing, always concave up function that grows without bound.  While <m>P(t) = Ae^{kt}</m> may be a reasonable model for how a population grows when it is relatively small, because the function grows without bound as time increases, it can't be a realistic long-term representation of what happens in reality.  Indeed, whether it is the number of fish who can survive in a lake, the number of cells in a petri dish, or the number of human beings on earth, the size of the surroundings and the limitations of resources will keep the population from being able to grow without bound.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		In light of these observations, a different model is needed for population, one that grows exponentially at first, but that levels off later.  Calculus can be used to develop such a model, and the resulting function is usually called the
    	<term>logistic function</term>, <idx><h>logistic function</h></idx> which has form
	    <men xml:id="eq-temp-pop-logistic">
	      P(t) = \frac{A}{1 + Me^{-kt}}
	    </men>,
    	where <m>A</m>, <m>M</m>, and <m>k</m> are positive constants.
    	Since <m>k \gt 0</m>, it follows that <m>e^{-kt} \to 0</m> as <m>t</m> increases without bound, and thus the denominator of <m>P</m> approaches <m>1</m> as time goes on.  Thus, we observe that <m>P(t)</m> tends to <m>A</m> as <m>t</m> increases without bound.  We sometimes refer to <m>A</m> as the <em>carrying capacity</em> of the population.

      <solution>
      
      
       SOLUTION 
      
      
      
      <alert>(a)</alert>
      We know that a logistic curve can be modeled by the function
      <me>P=\frac{L}{1+Ce^{-kt}}</me>
      where <m>C=(L-P_0)/P_0</m> and <m>P</m> is the number of people infected by
      the virus at a particular time <m>t</m>. We know that <m>L</m> is the limiting
      value, or the maximal number of people infected with the virus, so
      in our case
      <me>L=7250.</me>
      We are also told that initially there are only 25 people infected
      with the virus so that we get
      <m>P_0=25.</m>
      Thus we have
      <me>C = \frac{L-P_0}{P_0} = \frac{7250-25}{25} = 289.</me>
      We are also told that in the early stages of the virus, infection
      grows exponentially with <m>k=1.8</m>. Thus we get that the logistic
      function for people infected is
      <me>P=\frac{7250}{1+289 e^{-1.8 t}}.</me><alert>(b)</alert>
      Graphing this solution, we see
      
      
      
      
      <sidebyside widths="41.6666666666667%"><image source="images/webwork-108-image-1.png"/></sidebyside>
      
      
      
      
      Looking at the graph we see that the the point at which the rate
      changes from increasing to decreasing, the inflection point, occurs at
      roughly <m>t=3.25</m> giving a value of <m>P=3750</m>. Thus after roughly
      3750 people have been infected, the rate of infection starts dropping.

              <p>
        A closed tank with an inflow and outflow contains a <m>100</m> liters of saltwater solution.  Let the amount of salt in the tank at time <m>t</m> (in minutes) be given by the function <m>A(t)</m>, whose output is measured in grams.  At time <m>t = 0</m> there is an initial amount of salt present in the tank, and the inflow line also carries a saltwater mixture to the tank at a fixed rate; the outflow occurs at the same rate and carries a perfectly mixed solution out of the tank.  Because of these conditions, the volume of solution in the tank stays fixed over time, but the amount of salt possibly changes.
      </p>
              <p>
        It turns out that the problem of determining the amount of salt in the tank at time <m>t</m> is similar to the problem of determining the temperature of a warming or cooling object, and that the function <m>A(t)</m> has form
        <me>

        <me>
          A(t) = -500e^{-0.25t} + 750

        Again, <m>A(t)</m> measures the amount of salt in the tank after <m>t</m> minutes.

        <introduction>
          <p>
		In <xref ref="sec-circular-sine-cosine">Section</xref>, we defined the cosine and sine functions as the functions that track the location of a point traversing the unit circle counterclockwise from <m>(1,0)</m>.  In particular, for a central angle of radian measure <m>t</m> that passes through the point <m>(1,0)</m>, we define <m>\cos(t)</m> as the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the point where the other side of the angle intersects the unit circle, and <m>\sin(t)</m> as the <m>y</m>-coordinate of that same point, as pictured in <xref ref="F-right-sine-cosine-unit">Figure</xref>.
	</p>
          <p>
		By changing our perspective slightly, we can see that it is equivalent to think of the values of the sine and cosine function as representing the lengths of legs in right triangles.  Specifically, given a central angle<fn>In our work with right triangles, we'll often represent the angle by <m>\theta</m> and think of this angle as fixed, as opposed to our previous use of <m>t</m> where we frequently think of <m>t</m> as changing.</fn> <m>\theta</m>, if we think of the right triangle with vertices <m>(\cos(\theta),0)</m>, <m>(0,0)</m>, and <m>(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))</m>, then the length of the horizontal leg is <m>\cos(\theta)</m> and the length of the vertical leg is <m>\sin(\theta)</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-right-sine-cosine-right">Figure</xref>.

		This right triangle perspective enables us to use the sine and cosine functions to determine missing information in certain right triangles.  The field of mathematics that studies relationships among the angles and sides of triangles is called <em>trigonometry</em>. <idx><h>trigonometry</h></idx>  In addition, it's important to recall both the Pythagorean Theorem and the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity.  <idx><h>Pythagorean Theorem</h></idx> <idx><h>fundamental trigonometric identity</h></idx>  The former states that in any right triangle with legs of length <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and hypotenuse of length <m>c</m>, it follows <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.  The latter, which is a special case of the Pythagorean Theorem, says that for any angle <m>\theta</m>, <m>\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1</m>.

          <title>The geometry of triangles</title>
          <p>
  		In the study of functions, linear functions are the simplest of all and form a foundation for our understanding of functions that have other shapes.  In the study of geometric shapes (polygons, circles, and more), the simplest figure of all is the triangle, and understanding triangles is foundational to understanding many other geometric ideas.  To begin, we list some familiar and important facts about triangles.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		<ul><li>
  				<p>
  					Any triangle has <m>6</m> important features:  <m>3</m> sides and <m>3</m> angles.
  				</p>
  			</li><li>
  				<p>
  					In any triangle in the Cartesian plane, the sum of the measures of the interior angles is <m>\pi</m> radians (or equivalently, <m>180^\circ</m>).
  				</p>
  			</li><li>
  				<p>
  					In any triangle in the plane, knowing three of the six features of a triangle is often enough information to determine the missing three features.<fn>Formally, this idea relies on what are called <em>congruence criteria</em>.  For instance, if we know the lengths of all three sides, then the angle measures of the triangle are uniquely determined.  This is called the Side-Side-Side Criterion (SSS).  You are likely familiar with SSS, as well as SAS (Side-Angle-Side), ASA, and AAS, which are the four standard criteria.</fn>
  				</p>
  			</li></ul>
  	</p>
          <p>
		The situation is especially nice for right triangles, because then we only have five unknown features since one of the angles is <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians (or <m>90^\circ</m>), as demonstrated in <xref ref="F-right-triangle-5">Figure</xref>.  If we know one of the two non-right angles,
		then we know the other as well.  Moreover, if we know any two sides, we can immediately deduce the third, because of the Pythagorean Theorem.  As we saw in <xref ref="PA-trig-right">Preview Activity</xref>, the cosine and sine functions offer additional help in determining missing information in right triangles.  Indeed, while the functions <m>\cos(t)</m> and <m>\sin(t)</m> have many important applications in modeling periodic phenomena such as osciallating masses on springs, they also find powerful application in settings involving right triangles, such as in navigation and surveying.
	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-right-triangle-5">
            <caption>The <m>5</m> potential unknowns in a right triangle.</caption>
            <image source="images/right-triangle-5" width="70%"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
		Because we know the values of the cosine and sine functions from the unit circle, right triangles with hypotentuse <m>1</m> are the easiest ones in which to determine missing information.  In addition, we can relate any other right triangle to a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>1</m> through the concept of <em>similarity</em>.  Recall that two triangles are <term>similar</term> <idx><h>similar triangles</h></idx> provided that one is a magnification of the other.  More precisely, two triangles are similar whenever there is some constant <m>k</m> such that every side in one triangle is <m>k</m> times as long as the corresponding side in the other and the corresponding angles in the two triangles are equal.  An important result from geometry tells us that if two triangles are known to have all three of their corresponding angles equal, then it follows that the two triangles are similar, and therefore their corresponding sides must be proportionate to one another.

          <title>Ratios of sides in right triangles</title>
          <p>
  		A right triangle with a hypotenuse of length <m>1</m> can be viewed as lying in standard position in the unit circle, with one vertex at the origin and one leg along the positive <m>x</m>-axis.  If we let the angle formed by the hypotenuse and the horizontal leg have measure <m>\theta</m>, then the right triangle with hypotenuse <m>1</m> has horizontal leg of length <m>\cos(\theta)</m> and vertical leg of length <m>\sin(\theta)</m>.  If we consider now consider a similar right triangle with hypotenuse of length <m>r \ne 1</m>, we can view that triangle as a magnification of a triangle with hypotenuse <m>1</m>.  These observations, combined with our work in <xref ref="act-trig-right-similar">Activity</xref>, show us that the horizontal legs of the right triangle with hypotenuse <m>r</m> have measure <m>r\cos(\theta)</m> and <m>r\sin(\theta)</m>, as pictured in <xref ref="F-right-triangle-r-theta">Figure</xref>.
  	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-right-triangle-r-theta">
            <caption>The roles of <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> in a right triangle.</caption>
            <image width="70%" source="images/right-triangle-r-theta"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
		From the similar triangles in <xref ref="F-right-triangle-r-theta">Figure</xref>, we can make an important observation about ratios in right triangles.  Because the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides must be equal, so if we consider the two hypotenuses and the two horizontal legs, we have
		<men xml:id="eq-right-COH">
			\frac{r}{1} = \frac{r\cos(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}
		</men>.
		If we rearrange <xref ref="eq-right-COH">Equation</xref> by dividing both sides by <m>r</m> and multiplying both sides by <m>\cos(\theta)</m>, we see that
		<men xml:id="eq-right-COH-2">
			\frac{\cos(\theta)}{1} = \frac{r\cos(\theta)}{r}
		</men>.
		From a geometric perspective, <xref ref="eq-right-COH-2">Equation</xref> tells us that the ratio of the horizontal leg of a right triangle to the hypotenuse of the triangle is always the same (regardless of <m>r</m>) and that the value of that ratio is <m>\cos(\theta)</m>, where <m>\theta</m> is the angle adjacent to the horizontal leg.  In an analogous way, the equation involving the hypotenuses and vertical legs of the similar triangles is
		<men xml:id="eq-right-SOH">
			\frac{r}{1} = \frac{r\sin(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}
		</men>,
		which can be rearranged to
		<men xml:id="eq-right-SOH-2">
			\frac{\sin(\theta)}{1} = \frac{r\sin(\theta)}{r}
		</men>.
		<xref ref="eq-right-SOH-2">Equation</xref> shows that the ratio of the vertical leg of a right triangle to the hypotenuse of the triangle is always the same (regardless of <m>r</m>) and that the value of that ratio is <m>\sin(\theta)</m>, where <m>\theta</m> is the angle opposite the vertical leg.  We summarize these recent observations as follows.

          <title>Using a ratio involving sine and cosine</title>
          <p>
  		In <xref ref="act-trig-right-SOH-CAH">Activity</xref>, we found that in many cases where we have a right triangle, knowing two additional pieces of information enables us to find the remaining three unknown quantities in the triangle.  At this point in our studies, the following general principles hold.  
	</p>
          <assemblage xml:id="asm-trig-right-missing-info">
		<title>Missing information in right triangles</title>
			<p>
					In any right triangle,
			</p>

			<p>
		  		<ol><li>
		  				<p>
		  					if we know one of the non-right angles and the length of the hypotenuse, we can find both the remaining non-right angle and the lengths of the two legs;
		  				</p>
		  			</li><li>
		  				<p>
		  					if we know the length of two sides of the triangle, then we can find the length of the other side;
		  				</p>
		  			</li><li>
		  				<p>
		  					if we know the measure of one non-right angle, then we can find the measure of the remaining angle.
		  				</p>
		  			</li></ol>
			</p>
	</assemblage>
          <p>
  		In scenario (1.), all <m>6</m> features of the triangle are not only determined, but we are able to find their values.  In (2.), the triangle is uniquely determined by the given information, but as in <xref ref="act-trig-right-SOH-CAH">Activity</xref> parts (d) and (e), while we know the values of the sine and cosine of the angles in the triangle, we haven't yet developed a way to determine the measures of those angles.  Finally, in scenario (3.), the triangle is not uniquely determined, since any magnified version of the triangle will have the same three angles as the given one, and thus we need more information to determine side length.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		We will revisit scenario (2) in our future work.  Now, however, we want to consider a situation that is similar to (1), but where it is one leg of the triangle instead of the hypotenuse that is known.  We encountered this in <xref ref="act-trig-right-SOH-CAH">Activity</xref> part (f): a right triangle where one of the non-right angles is <m>\beta = \frac{\pi}{5}</m> and the leg opposite this angle has length <m>4</m>.

              <p>
					From the fact that <m>\beta = \frac{\pi}{5}</m>, it follows that <m>\alpha = \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{5} = \frac{3\pi}{10}</m>.  In addition, we know that

						\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{x}{h}
					</men>
				</p>
              <p>
				Solving <xref ref="eq-right-sin-ratio">Equation</xref> for <m>h</m>, we see that
				<men xml:id="eq-right-sin-ratio-2">
						h = \frac{4}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)}
				</men>, which is the exact numerical value of <m>h</m>.  Substituting this result in 
				<xref ref="eq-right-cos-ratio">Equation</xref>, solving for <m>h</m> we find that
				<men xml:id="eq-right-cos-ratio-2">
						\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{x}{\frac{4}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)}}
				</men>.
				Solving this equation for the single unknown <m>x</m> shows that
				<me>
					x = \frac{4 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)}
				</me>.
				The approximate values of <m>x</m> and <m>h</m> are <m>x \approx 5.506</m> and <m>h \approx  6.805</m>.

		<xref ref="ex-right-sin-cos-ratio">Example</xref> demonstrates that a ratio of values of the sine and cosine function can be needed in order to determine the value of one of the missing sides of a right triangle, and also that we may need to work with two unknown quantities simultaneously in order to determine both of their values.

          <title>Summary</title>
          <ul>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				In a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>1</m>, we can view <m>\cos(\theta)</m> as the length of the leg adjacent to <m>\theta</m> and <m>\sin(\theta)</m> as the length of the leg opposite <m>\theta</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-right-sine-cosine-right">Figure</xref>.  This is simply a change in perspective achieved by focusing on the triangle as opposed to the unit circle.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				Because a right triangle with hypotenuse of length <m>r</m> can be thought of as a scaled version of a right triangle with hypotenuse of length <m>1</m>, we can conclude that in a right triangle with hypotenuse of length <m>r</m>, the leg adjacent to angle <m>\theta</m> has length <m>r\cos(\theta)</m>, and the leg opposite <m>\theta</m> has length <m>r\sin(\theta)</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-right-triangle-r-theta">Figure</xref>.  Moreover, in any right triangle with angle <m>\theta</m>, we know that
  				<me>
					\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adj}}{\text{hyp}} \text{ and } \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}}
				</me>.
			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				In a right triangle, there are five additional characteristics:  the measures of the two non-right angles and the lengths of the three sides.  In general, if we know one of those two angles and one of the three sides, we can determine all of the remaining pieces.

			In <xref ref="act-trig-right-sine-cosine-ratio">Activity</xref>, we determined the distance between two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> on opposite sides of a river by knowing a length along one shore of the river and the angle formed between a point downstream and the point on the opposite shore, as pictured in <xref ref="F-right-act-river-rev">Figure</xref>. By first using the cosine of the angle, we determined the value of <m>z</m> and from there were able to use the sine of the angle to find <m>w</m>, the river's width, which turns out to be 
			<me>
				w = 50 \cdot \frac{\sin(56.4)}{\cos(56.4)}
			</me>.

          <p>
		It turns out that we regularly need to evaluate the ratio of the sine and cosine functions at the same angle, so it is convenient to define a new function to be their ratio.

            </figure>

          <p>
  		Because the tangent function is defined in terms of the two fundamental circular functions by the rule <m>\tan(t) = \frac{\sin(t)}{\cos(t)}</m>, we can use our understanding of the sine and cosine functions to make sense of the tangent function.  In particular, we can think of the tangent of an angle from two different perspectives: as an angle in standard position in the unit circle, or as an angle in a right triangle.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		From the viewpoint of <xref ref="F-tan-defn-unit-circle">Figure</xref>, as the point corresponding to angle <m>t</m> traverses the circle and generates the point <m>(a,b)</m>, we know <m>\cos(t) = a</m> and <m>\sin(t) = b</m>, and therefore the tangent function tracks the ratio of these two quantities, and is given by
  		<me>
  			\tan(t) = \frac{\sin(t)}{\cos(t)} = \frac{b}{a}
  		</me>.
  		From the perspective of any right triangle (not necessarily in the unit circle) with hypotenuse <q>hyp</q> and legs
  		<q>adj</q> and <q>opp</q> that are respectively adjacent and opposite the known angle <m>\theta</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-tan-right-triangle-TOA">Figure</xref>, we know that <m>\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}}</m> and <m>\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adj}}{\text{hyp}}</m>.  Substituting these expressions for <m>\sin(\theta)</m> and <m>\cos(\theta)</m> in the rule for the tangent function, we see that
  		<me>
  			\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{\frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}}}{\frac{\text{adj}}{\text{hyp}}} = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}}
  		</me>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		We typically use the first perspective of tracking the ratio of the <m>y</m>-coordinate to the <m>x</m>-coordinate of a point traversing the unit circle in order to think of the overall behavior and graph of the tangent function, and use the second perspective in a right triangle whenever we are working to determine missing values in a triangle.
  	</p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection xml:id="subsec-trig-tangent-properties">
          <title>Properties of the tangent function</title>
          <p>
	  	Because the tangent function is defined in terms of the sine and cosine functions, its values and behavior are completely determined by those two functions.  To begin, we know the value of <m>\tan(t)</m> for every special angle <m>t</m> on the unit circle that we identified for the sine and cosine functions.  For instance, we know that
	  	<me>
	  		\tan \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) = \frac{ \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) }{ \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) } = \frac{ \frac{1}{2} }{ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} } = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
	  	</me>.
	  	Executing similar computations for every familiar special angle on the unit circle, we find the results shown in <xref ref="T-tangent-values">Table</xref> and <xref ref="T-tangent-values-2">Table</xref>.  We also note that anywhere <m>\cos(t) = 0</m>, the value of <m>\tan(t)</m> is undefined.  We record such instances in the table by writing <q>u</q>.

          <p>
			<xref ref="T-tangent-values">Table</xref> and <xref ref="T-tangent-values-2">Table</xref> helps us identify trends in the tangent function.  For instance, we observe that the sign of <m>\tan(t)</m> is positive in Quadrant I, negative in Quadrant II, positive in Quadrant III, and negative in Quadrant IV.  This holds because the sine and cosine functions have the same sign in the first and third quadrants, and opposite signs in the other two quadrants.  
		</p>
          <p>
			In addition, we observe that as <m>t</m>-values in the first quadrant get closer to <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, <m>\sin(t)</m> gets closer to <m>1</m>, while <m>\cos(t)</m> gets closer to <m>0</m> (while being always positive).  Noting that <m>\frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.57</m>, we observe that
			<me>
				\tan(1.47) = \frac{\sin(1.47)}{\cos(1.47)} \approx \frac{0.995}{0.101} = 9.887
			</me>
			and
			<me>
				\tan(1.56) = \frac{\sin(1.56)}{\cos(1.56)} \approx \frac{0.9994}{0.0108} = 92.6205
			</me>.
			Because the ratio of numbers closer and closer to <m>1</m> divided by numbers closer and closer to <m>0</m> (but positive) increases without bound, this means that <m>\tan(t)</m> increases without bound as <m>t</m> approaches <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> from the left side.  Once <m>t</m> is slightly greater than <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> in Quadrant II, the value of <m>\sin(t)</m> stays close to <m>1</m>, but now the value of <m>\cos(t)</m> is negative (and close to zero).  For instance, <m>\cos(1.58) \approx -0.0092</m>.  This makes the value of <m>\tan(t)</m> decrease without bound (negative and getting further away from <m>0</m>) for <m>t</m> approaching <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> from the right side, and results in <m>h(t) = \tan(t)</m> having a vertical asymptote at <m>t = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.  The periodicity and sign behaviors of <m>\sin(t)</m> and <m>\cos(t)</m> mean this asymptotic behavior of the tangent function will repeat.

			While the tangent function is an interesting mathematical function for its own sake, its most important applications arise in the setting of right triangles, and for the remainder of this section we will focus on that perspective.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-trig-tangent-applications">
          <title>Using the tangent function in right triangles</title>
          <p>
  		The tangent function offers us an additional choice when working in right triangles with limited information.  In the setting where we have a right triangle with one additional known angle, if we know the length of the hypotenuse, we can use either the sine or cosine of the angle to help us easily find the remaining side lengths.  But in the setting where we know only the length of one leg, the tangent function now allows us to determine the value of the remaining leg in a similarly straightforward way, and from there the hypotenuse.
  	</p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <p>
  					Use the tangent function to determine the width, <m>w</m>, of the river in <xref ref="F-right-act-river-rev-2">Figure</xref>.  (Note that here we are revisiting the problem in <xref ref="act-trig-right-sine-cosine-ratio">Activity</xref>, which we previously solved without using the tangent function.)  What other information can we now easily determine?
 	 			</p>
              <figure xml:id="F-right-act-river-rev-2">
                <caption>A right triangle with one angle and one leg known.</caption>
                <image width="40%" source="images/right-act-river-riv"/>
              </figure>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
  				Using the perspective that <m>\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}}</m> in a right triangle, in this context we have 
  				<me>
  					\tan(56.4^\circ) = \frac{w}{50} 
  				</me>
  				and thus <m>w = 50\tan(56.4)</m> is the exact width of the river.  Using a computational device, we find that <m>w \approx 75.256</m>.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				Once we know the river's width, we can use the Pythagorean theorem or the sine function to determine the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>A</m>, at which point all <m>6</m> parts of the triangle are known.
 		 	</p>
            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
  		The tangent function finds a wide range of applications in finding missing information in right triangles where information about one or more legs of the triangle is known.

Next, they move <m>1000</m> feet closer to the hill, staying at the same elevation relative to sea level, and find that the angle of elevation has increased to <m>25^\circ</m>, as pictured in <xref ref="F-tan-act-mountain">Figure</xref>.  We let <m>h</m> represent the height of the hill relative to the two measurements, and <m>x</m> represent the distance from the second measurement location to the <q>center</q> of the hill that lies directly under the peak.

          <ul>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				The tangent function is defined defined to be the ratio of the sine and cosine functions according to the rule
  				<me>
  					\tan(t) = \frac{\sin(t)}{\cos(t)}
  				</me>
  				for all values of <m>t</m> for which <m>\cos(t) \ne 0</m>.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				The graph of the tangent function differs substantially from the graphs of the sine and cosine functions, primarily because near values where <m>\cos(t) = 0</m>, the ratio of <m>\frac{\sin(t)}{\cos(t)}</m> increases or decreases without bound, producing vertical asymptotes.  In addition, while the period of the sine and cosine functions is <m>P = 2\pi</m>, the period of the tangent function is <m>P = \pi</m> due to how the sine and cosine functions repeat the same values (with different signs) as a point traverses the unit circle.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				The tangent function finds some of its most important applications in the setting of right triangles where one leg of the triangle is known and one of the non-right angles is known.  Computing the tangent of the known angle, say <m>\alpha</m>, and using the fact that
  				<me>
  					\tan(\alpha) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}}
  				</me>
  				we can then find the missing leg's length in terms of the other and the tangent of the angle.

      Since <m>3 \pi /2 \leq \phi \leq 2 \pi</m>, <m>\sin{ ( \phi ) }</m>
      is negative, so <m>\sin{ ( \phi ) } \approx - 0.5507</m>.

      (a) Using the Pythagorean Identity <m>\sin^2{ ( \theta )} + \cos^2{ ( \theta ) } =1</m>, we can solve for <m>\cos{ ( \theta )}</m>:
      <me>\cos^2{ ( \theta ) } = 1 - \sin^2{ ( \theta ) } = 1 - \left( \frac{x}{8} \right)^2 = \frac{ 64 - x^2}{64}.</me>

  </objectives>
        <introduction>
          <p>
  		In our prior work with inverse functions, we have seen several important principles, including
	    <ul><li>
	        <p>
	          A function <m>f</m> has an inverse function
	          if and only if there exists a function <m>g</m> that undoes the work of <m>f</m>. Such
	          a function <m>g</m> has the properties that
	          <m>g(f(x)) = x</m> for each <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>,
	          and <m>f(g(y)) = y</m> for each <m>y</m> in the range of <m>f</m>.
	          We call <m>g</m> the inverse of <m>f</m>,
	          and write <m>g = f^{-1}</m>.
	        </p>
	      </li><li>
	        <p>
	          A function <m>f</m> has an inverse function if and only if the graph of <m>f</m> passes the
	          <xref ref="asm-inverse-H-L-test" text="title"/>.
	        </p>
	      </li><li>
	        <p>
	          When <m>f</m> has an inverse,
	          we know that writing <q><m>y = f(t)</m></q>
	          and <q><m>t = f^{-1}(y)</m></q>
	          say the exact same thing,
	          but from two different perspectives.
	        </p>
	      </li></ul>
  	  </p>
          <p>
	    The trigonometric functions <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m>,
	    <m>g(t) = \cos(t)</m>, and <m>h(t) = \tan(t)</m> are periodic, so each fails the horizontal line test,
	    and thus these functions on their full domains do not have inverse functions.
	    At the same time, it is reasonable to think about changing perspective and viewing angles as outputs in certain restricted settings.
	    For instance, we may want to say both
	    <me>
	      \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) \ \ \ \mbox{and}  \ \ \ \frac{\pi}{6} = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
	    </me>
	    depending on the context in which we are considering the relationship between the angle and side length.
	  </p>
          <p>
	    It's also important to understand why the issue of finding an angle in terms of a known value of a trigonometric function is important.
	    Suppose we know the following information about a right triangle:
	    one leg has length <m>2.5</m>, and the hypotenuse has length <m>4</m>.
	    If we let <m>\theta</m> be the angle opposite the side of length <m>2.5</m>, it follows that <m>\sin(\theta) = \frac{2.5}{4}</m>.
	    We naturally want to use the inverse of the sine function to solve the most recent equation for <m>\theta</m>.  But the sine function does not have an inverse function, so how can we address this situation?
	  </p>
          <p>
	    While the original trigonometric functions <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m>,
	    <m>g(t) = \cos(t)</m>, and
	    <m>h(t) = \tan(t)</m> do not have inverse functions,
	    it turns out that we can consider restricted versions of them that do
	    have corresponding inverse functions.  We thus investigate how we can think differently about the 
	    trigonometric functions so that we can discuss inverses in a meaningful way.
	  </p>

          <title>The arccosine function</title>
          <p>
  		For the cosine function restricted to the domain <m>[0,\pi]</m> that we considered in <xref ref="PA-trig-inverse">Preview Activity</xref>, the function is strictly decreasing on its domain and thus passes the Horizontal Line Test.  Therefore, this restricted version of the cosine function has an inverse function; we will call this inverse function the <term>arccosine</term> function.

          <definition xml:id="def-inverse-trig-arccosine">
            <idx>
              <h>inverse trigonometric functions</h>
              <h>arccosine</h>
            </idx>
            <statement>
              <p>
  				Let <m>y = g(t) = \cos(t)</m> be defined on the domain <m>[0,\pi]</m>, and observe <m>g : [0,\pi] \to [-1,1]</m>.  For any real number <m>y</m> that satisfies <m>-1 \le y \le 1</m>, the <term>arccosine of <m>y</m></term>, denoted 
  				<me>
  					\arccos(y)
  				</me>
  				is the angle <m>t</m> satisfying <m>0 \le t \le \pi</m> such that <m>\cos(t) = y</m>.
  			</p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
		Note particularly that the output of the arccosine function is an angle.  In addition, recall that in the context of the unit circle, an angle measured in radians and the corresponding arc length along the unit circle are numerically equal.  This is why we use the <q>arc</q> in <q>arccosine</q>: given a value <m>-1 \le y \le 1</m>, the arccosine function produces the corresponding <em>arc</em> (measured counterclockwise from <m>(1,0)</m>) such that the cosine of that arc is <m>y</m>.
	</p>
          <p>
		We recall that for any function with an inverse function, the inverse function reverses the process of the original function.  We know that <q><m>y = \cos(t)</m></q> can be read as saying <q><m>y</m> is the cosine of the angle <m>t</m></q>.  Changing perspective and writing the equivalent statement <q><m>t = \arccos(y)</m></q>, we read this statement as <q><m>t</m> is the angle whose cosine is <m>y</m></q>.  Just as <m>y = f(t)</m> and <m>t = f^{-1}(y)</m> say the same thing for a function and its inverse in general,
		<me>
			y = \cos(t) \ \text{ and } \ t = \arccos(y)
		</me>
		say the same thing for any angle <m>t</m> that satisfies <m>0 \le t \le \pi</m>.  We also use the equivalent notation <m>t = \cos^{-1}(y)</m> interchangeably with <m>t = \arccos(y)</m>.  We read <q><m>t = \cos^{-1}(y)</m></q> as <q><m>t</m> is the angle whose cosine is <m>y</m></q> or <q><m>t</m> is the inverse cosine of <m>y</m></q>.  Key properties of the arccosine function can be summarized as follows.

		Just as the natural logarithm function allowed us to rewrite exponential equations in an equivalent way (for instance, <m>y = e^t</m> and <m>t = \ln(y)</m> say the exact same thing), the arccosine function allows us to do likewise for certain angles and cosine outputs.  For instance, saying <m>\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 0</m> is the same as writing <m>\frac{\pi}{2} = \arccos(0)</m>, which reads <q><m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> is the angle whose cosine is <m>0</m></q>.  Indeed, these relationships are reflected in the plot above, where we see that any point <m>(a,b)</m> that lies on the graph of <m>y = \cos(t)</m> corresponds to the point <m>(b,a)</m> that lies on the graph of <m>y = \arccos(t)</m>.

          <title>The arcsine function</title>
          <p>
  		We can develop an inverse function for a restricted version of the sine function in a similar way.  As with the cosine function, we need to choose an interval on which the sine function is always increasing or always decreasing in order to have the function pass the horizontal line test.  The standard choice is the domain <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]</m> on which <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m> is increasing and attains all of the values in the range of the sine function.  Thus, we consider <m>f(t) = \sin(t)</m> so that <m>f : [-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}] \to [-1,1]</m> and hence define the corresponding arcsine function.

  				Any function that fails the Horizontal Line Test cannot have an inverse function.  However, for a periodic function that fails the horizontal line test, if we restrict the domain of the function to an interval that is the length of a single period of the function, we then determine a related function that does, in fact, have an inverse function.  This makes it possible for us to develop the inverse functions of the restricted cosine, sine, and tangent functions.

  				We choose to define the restricted cosine, sine, and tangent functions on the respective domains <m>[0,\pi]</m>, <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]</m>, and <m>(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})</m>.  On each such interval, the restricted function is strictly decreasing (cosine) or strictly increasing (sine and tangent), and thus has an inverse function.  The restricted sine and cosine functions each have range <m>[-1,1]</m>, while the restricted tangent's range is the set of all real numbers.  We thus define the inverse function of each as follows:

        Let's consider the composite function <m>h(x) = \cos(\arcsin(x))</m>.  This function makes sense to consider since the arcsine function produces an angle, at which the cosine function can then be evaluated.  In the questions that follow, we investigate how to express <m>h</m> without using trigonometric functions at all.

                Since the arcsine function produces an angle, let's say that <m>\theta = \arcsin(x)</m>,  so that <m>\theta</m> is the angle whose sine is <m>x</m>.  By definition, we can picture <m>\theta</m> as an angle in a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>1</m> and a vertical leg of length <m>x</m>, as shown in <xref ref="F-inv-trig-cosarcsin">Figure</xref>.  Use the Pythagorean Theorem to determine the length of the horizontal leg as a function of <m>x</m>.

  				How can we use inverse trigonometric functions to determine missing angles in right triangles?
  			</p>
  		</li><li>
        <p>
          What situations require us to use technology to evaluate inverse trignometric functions?
        </p>
      </li></ul>
  </objectives>
        <introduction>
          <p>
  			In our earlier work in <xref ref="sec-trig-right">Section</xref> and <xref ref="sec-trig-tangent">Section</xref>, we observed that in any right triangle, if we know the measure of one additional angle and the length of one additional side, we can determine all of the other parts of the triangle.  With the inverse trigonometric functions that we developed in <xref ref="sec-trig-inverse">Section</xref>, we are now also able to determine the missing angles in any right triangle where we know the lengths of two sides.
  		</p>
          <p>
        While the original trigonometric functions take a particular angle as input and provide an output that can be viewed as the ratio of two sides of a right triangle, the inverse trigonometric functions take an input that can be viewed as a ratio of two sides of a right triangle and produce the corresponding angle as output.  Indeed, it's imperative to remember that statements such as 
        <me>

          <title>Evaluating inverse trigonometric functions</title>
          <p>
      Like the trigonometric functions themselves, there are a handful of important values of the inverse trigonometric functions that we can determine exactly without the aid of a computer.  For instance, we know from the unit circle (<xref ref="F-circular-sine-all-16">Figure</xref>) that <m>\arcsin(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = -\frac{\pi}{3}</m>, <m>\arccos(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{5\pi}{6}</m>, and <m>\arctan(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = -\frac{\pi}{6}</m>.  In these evaluations, we have to be careful to remember that the range of the arccosine function is <m>[0,\pi]</m>, while the range of the arcsine function is <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]</m> and the range of the arctangent function is <m>(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})</m>, in order to ensure that we choose the appropriate angle that results from the inverse trigonometric function.
    </p>
          <p>
      In addition, there are many other values at which we may wish to know the angle that results from an inverse trigonometric function.  To determine such values, we use a computational device (such as <em>Desmos</em>) in order to evaluate the function.
    </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <sidebyside widths="40% 55%" margins="0%">
                <p>
            Consider the right triangle pictured in <xref ref="F-finding-angles-ex-1">Figure</xref> and assume we know that the vertical leg has length <m>1</m> and the hypotenuse has length <m>3</m>.  Let <m>\alpha</m> be the angle opposite the known leg.  Determine exact and approximate values for all of the remaining parts of the triangle.
          </p>
                <figure xml:id="F-finding-angles-ex-1">
                  <caption>A right triangle with one known leg and known hypotenuse.</caption>
                  <image source="images/finding-angles-ex-1"/>
                </figure>
              </sidebyside>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
          Because we know the hypotenuse and the side opposite <m>\alpha</m>, we observe that <m>\sin(\alpha) = \frac{1}{3}</m>.  Rewriting this statement using inverse function notation, we have equivalently that <m>\alpha = \arcsin(\frac{1}{3})</m>, which is the exact value of <m>\alpha</m>.  Since this is not one of the known special angles on the unit circle, we can find a numerical estimate of <m>\alpha</m> using a computational device.  Entering <c>arcsin(1/3)</c> in <em>Desmos</em>, we find that <m>\alpha \approx 0.3398</m> radians.  Note well: whatever device we use, we need to be careful to use degree or radian mode as dictated by the problem we are solving.  We will always work in radians unless stated otherwise.
        </p>
              <p>
          We can now find the remaining leg's length and the remaining angle's measure.  If we let <m>x</m> represent the length of the horizontal leg, by the Pythagorean Theorem we know that
          <me>x^2 + 1^2 = 3^2</me>,
          and thus <m>x^2 = 8</m> so <m>x = \sqrt{8} \approx 2.8284</m>.  Calling the remaining angle <m>\beta</m>, since <m>\alpha + \beta = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>, it follows that 
          <me>
            \beta = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx 1.2310
          </me>.
        </p>
            </solution>

      Now that we have developed the (restricted) sine, cosine, and tangent functions and their respective inverses, in any setting in which we have a right triangle together with one side length and any one additional piece of information (another side length or a non-right angle measurement), we can determine all of the remaining pieces of the triangle.  In the activities that follow, we explore these possibilities in a variety of different applied contexts.

              Anytime we know two side lengths in a right triangle, we can use one of the inverse trigonometric functions to determine the measure of one of the non-right angles.  For instance, if we know the values of <m>\text{opp}</m> and <m>\text{adj}</m> in <xref ref="F-finding-angles-SOH-CAH-TOA">Figure</xref>, then since 
              <me>
                \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}}
              </me>,
              it follows that <m>\theta = \arctan(\frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}})</m>.
            </p>
          <p>
            If we instead know the hypotenuse and one of the two legs, we can use either the arcsine or arccosine function accordingly.

            For situations other than angles or ratios that involve the <m>16</m> special points on the unit circle, technology is required in order to evaluate inverse trignometric functions.  For instance, from the unit circle we know that <m>\arccos(\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{\pi}{3}</m> (exactly), but if we want to know <m>\arccos(\frac{1}{3})</m>, we have to estimate this value using a computational device such as <em>Desmos</em>.  We note that <q><m>\arccos(\frac{1}{3})</m></q> is the exact value of the angle whose cosine is <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>.

                  <m>\sin^2{ ( \phi ) } + \left( 0.7087 \right)^2 = 1</m><m>\sin^2{ ( \phi ) } = 1 - \left( 0.7087 \right)^2</m><m>\sin{ ( \phi ) } = \pm \sqrt{0.4977} \approx  \pm 0.7055</m> . 
      
      
         
      
      
      Since <m>3 \pi /2 \leq \phi \leq 2 \pi</m>, <m>\sin{ ( \phi ) }</m>
      is negative, so <m>\sin{ ( \phi ) } \approx - 0.7055</m>.
      
      
         
      
      
      b) <m>\tan{ ( \phi ) }= \frac{ \sin{ ( \phi )}}{\cos{ ( \phi )}} = \frac{- 0.7055}{0.7087} \approx -0.9955</m></solution>

      (a) Using the Pythagorean Identity <m>\sin^2{ ( \theta )} + \cos^2{ ( \theta ) } =1</m>, we can solve for <m>\cos{ ( \theta )}</m>:
      <me>\cos^2{ ( \theta ) } = 1 - \sin^2{ ( \theta ) } = 1 - \left( \frac{x}{7} \right)^2 = \frac{ 49 - x^2}{49}.</me>

      By sketching a graph, we see that there are four solutions:
      
      
      
      
      <sidebyside widths="25%"><image source="images/webwork-124-image-1.png"/></sidebyside>
      
      
      
      
      The first solution is given by <m>x =\arccos{(0.7)} \approx 0.7954</m>,
      which is equivalent to the length labeled <m>x1</m> in the figure above.
      Next, note that, by the symmetry of the graph of the cosine function,
      we can obtain a second solution by subtracting the length <m>x1</m> from
      <m>2\pi</m>.  Therefore, a second solution to the equation is given by
      <m>x \approx 2\pi - 0.7954 = 5.4878</m> (labeled <m>x2</m>).  Similarly,
      our final two solutions are given by <m>x = 2\pi + 0.7954 = 7.0786</m>
      and <m>x = 4 \pi - 0.7954 = 11.771</m> which are labeled <m>x3</m> and
      <m>x4</m> respectively in the figure above.

  		The sine and cosine functions, originally defined in the context of a point traversing the unit circle, are also central in right triangle trigonometry.  They enable us to find missing information in right triangles in a straightforward way when we know one of the non-right angles and one of the three sides of the triangle, or two of the sides where one is the hypotenuse.  In addition, we defined the tangent function in terms of the sine and cosine functions, and the tangent function offers additional options for finding missing information in right triangles.  We've also seeen how the inverses of the restricted sine, cosine, and tangent functions enable us to find missing angles in a wide variety of settings involving right triangles.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		One of the powerful aspects of trigonometry is that the subject offers us the opportunity to view the same idea from many different perspectives. As one example, we have observed that the functions <m>f(t) = \cos(t)</m> and <m>g(t) = \sin(t+\frac{\pi}{2})</m> are actually the same function; as another, for <m>t</m> values in the domain <m>(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})</m>, we know that writing <m>y = \tan(t)</m> is the same as writing <m>t = \arctan(y)</m>.  Which perspective we choose to take often depends on context and given information.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		While almost every question involving trigonometry can be answered using the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, sometimes it is convenient to use three related functions that are connected to the other three possible arrangements of ratios of sides in right triangles.

  		Note particularly that like the tangent function, the secant, cosecant, and cotangent are also defined completely in terms of the sine and cosine functions.  In the context of a right triangle with an angle <m>\theta</m>, we know how to think of <m>\sin(\theta)</m>,  <m>\cos(\theta)</m>, and <m>\tan(\theta)</m> as ratios of sides of the triangle.  We can now do likewise with the other trigonometric functions:

			Consider a right triangle with hypotenuse of length <m>61</m> and one leg of length <m>11</m>.

          <title>Ratios in right triangles</title>
          <p>
  		Because the sine and cosine functions are used to define each of the other four trigonometric functions, it follows that we can translate information known about the other functions back to information about the sine and cosine functions.  For example, if we know that in a certain triangle <m>\csc(\alpha) = \frac{5}{3}</m>, it follows that <m>\sin(\alpha) = \frac{3}{5}</m>.  From there we can reason in the usual way to determine missing information in the given triangle.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		It's also often possible to view given information in the context of the unit circle.  With the earlier given information that <m>\csc(\alpha) = \frac{5}{3}</m>, it's natural to view <m>\alpha</m> as being the angle in a right triangle that lies opposite a leg of length <m>3</m> with the hypotenuse being <m>5</m>, since <m>\csc(\alpha) = \frac{\text{hyp}}{\text{opp}}</m>.  The Pythagorean Theorem then tells us the leg adjacent to <m>\alpha</m> has length <m>4</m>, as seen in <m>\triangle OPQ</m> in <xref ref="F-other-3-4-5">Figure</xref>.
  	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-other-3-4-5">

            <image source="images/other-right-triangle-3-4-5" width="50%"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
  		But we could also view <m>\sin(\alpha) = \frac{3}{5}</m> as <m>\sin(\alpha) = \frac{\frac{3}{5}}{1}</m>, and thus think of the right triangle has having hypotenuse <m>1</m> and vertical leg <m>\frac{3}{5}</m>.  This triangle is similar to the originally considered <m>3</m>-<m>4</m>-<m>5</m> right triangle, but can be viewed as lying within the unit circle.  The perspective of the unit circle is particularly valuable when ratios such as <m>\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m>, <m>\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}</m>, and <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> arise in right triangles.

          <p>
  		Like the tangent function, the secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions are defined in terms of the sine and cosine functions, so we can determine the exact values of these functions at each of the special points on the unit circle.  In addition, we can use our understanding of the unit circle and the properties of the sine and cosine functions to determine key properties of these other trigonometric functions.  We begin by investigating the secant function.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		Using the fact that <m>\sec(t) = \frac{1}{\cos(t)}</m>, we note that anywhere <m>\cos(t) = 0</m>, the value of <m>\sec(t)</m> is undefined.  We denote such instances in the following table by <q>u</q>.  At all other points, the value of the secant function is simply the reciprocal of the cosine function's value.  Since <m>|\cos(t)| \le 1</m> for all <m>t</m>, it follows that <m>|\sec(t)| \ge 1</m> for all <m>t</m> (for which the secant's value is defined).

			<xref ref="T-secant-values">Table</xref> and <xref ref="T-secant-values-2">Table</xref> help us identify trends in the secant function.  The sign of <m>\sec(t)</m> matches the sign of <m>\cos(t)</m> and thus is positive in Quadrant I, negative in Quadrant II, negative in Quadrant III, and positive in Quadrant IV.    
		</p>
          <p>
			In addition, we observe that as <m>t</m>-values in the first quadrant get closer to <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, <m>\cos(t)</m> gets closer to <m>0</m> (while being always positive).  Since the numerator of the secant function is always <m>1</m>, having its denominator approach <m>0</m> (while the denominator remains positive) means that <m>\sec(t)</m> increases without bound as <m>t</m> approaches <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> from the left side.  Once <m>t</m> is slightly greater than <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> in Quadrant II, the value of <m>\cos(t)</m> is negative (and close to zero).  This makes the value of <m>\sec(t)</m> decrease without bound (negative and getting further away from <m>0</m>) for <m>t</m> approaching <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> from the right side.  We therefore see that <m>p(t) = \sec(t)</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>t = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>; the periodicity and sign behavior of <m>\cos(t)</m> mean this asymptotic behavior of the secant function will repeat.
		</p>
          <p>	
			Plotting the data in the table along with the expected asymptotes and connecting the points intuitively, we see the graph of the secant function in <xref ref="F-secant-plot">Figure</xref>.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-trig-other-identities">
          <title>A few important identities</title>
          <p>
  		An <em>identity</em> is an equation that is true for all possible values of <m>x</m> for which the involved quantities are defined.  An example of a non-trigonometric identity is
	    <me>
	      (x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
	    </me>,
    	since this equation is true for every value of <m>x</m>,
    	and the left and right sides of the equation are simply two different-looking but entirely equivalent expressions.
  	</p>
          <p>
	    Trigonometric identities are simply identities that involve trigonometric functions.  While there are a large number of such identities one can study, we choose to focus on those that turn out to be most useful in the study of calculus.  The most important trigonometric identity is the fundamental trigonometric identity,
	    which is a trigonometric restatement of the Pythagorean Theorem.
	  </p>
          <assemblage xml:id="asm-other-trig-fundamental-identity">
		<idx><h>fundamental trigonometric identity</h></idx>
		<title>The fundamental trigonometric identity</title>
		<p>
			For any real number <m>\theta</m>,
			<men xml:id="eq-fund-trig-identity">
				\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1
			</men>.
		</p>
		
	</assemblage>
          <p>
		Identities are important because they enable us to view the same idea from multiple perspectives.  For example, the fundamental trigonometric identity allows us to think of <m>\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta)</m> as simply <m>1</m>, or alternatively, to view <m>\cos^2(\theta)</m> as the same quantity as <m>1 - \sin^2(\theta)</m>.
	</p>
          <p>
	    There are two related Pythagorean identities that involve the tangent, secant,
	    cotangent, and cosecant functions, which we can derive from the fundamental trigonometric identity by dividing both sides by either <m>\cos^2(\theta)</m> or <m>\sin^2(\theta)</m>.  If we divide both sides of <xref ref="eq-fund-trig-identity">Equation</xref> by <m>\cos^2(\theta)</m> (and assume that <m>\cos(\theta) \ne 0</m>), we see that
	    <me>
	    	1 + \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\cos^2(\theta)} = \frac{1}{\cos^2(\theta)} 
	    </me>, or equivalently,
	    <me>
	    	1 + \tan^2(\theta) = \sec^2(\theta) 
	    </me>.
	    A similar argument dividing by <m>\sin^2(\theta)</m> (while assuming <m>\sin(\theta) \ne 0</m>) shows that
	    <me>
	    	\cot^2(\theta) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta) 
	    </me>.  These identities prove useful in calculus when we develop the formulas for the derivatives of the tangent and cotangent functions.
	  </p>
          <p>
	    In calculus, it is also beneficial to know a couple of other standard identities for sums of angles or double angles. <idx><h>sum of two angles identity</h></idx> <idx><h>double angle identity</h></idx>  We simply state these identities without justification.

			In this activity, we investigate how a sum of two angles identity for the sine function helps us gain a different perspective on the average rate of change of the sine function.
		</p>
              <p>
			Recall that for any function <m>f</m> on an interval <m>[a,a+h]</m>, its average rate of change is
			<me>
				AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
			</me>.
		</p>
              <p>
			<ol label="a."><li>
					<p>
						Let <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>.  Use the definition of <m>AV_{[a,a+h]}</m> to write an expression for the average rate of change of the sine function on the interval <m>[a+h,a]</m>.
					</p>
				</li><li>
					<p>
						Apply the sum of two angles identity for the sine function, <m>\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin(\alpha) \cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha) \sin(\beta)</m>, to the expression <m>\sin(a+h)</m>.
					</p>
				</li><li>
					<p>
						Explain why your work in (a) and (b) together with some algebra shows that 
						<me>
							AV_{[a,a+h]} = \sin(a) \cdot \frac{\cos(h)-1}{h} - \cos(a) \frac{\sin(h)}{h}
						</me>.
					</p>
				</li><li>
					<p>
						In calculus, we move from <em>average</em> rate of change to <em>instantaneous</em> rate of change by letting <m>h</m> approach <m>0</m> in the expression for average rate of change.  Using a computational device in radian mode, investigate the behavior of 
						<me>
							\frac{\cos(h)-1}{h}
						</me>
						as <m>h</m> gets close to <m>0</m>.  What happens?  Similarly, how does <m>\frac{\sin(h)}{h}</m> behave for small values of <m>h</m>?  What does this tell us about <m>AV_{[a,a+h]}</m> for the sine function as <m>h</m> approaches <m>0</m>?

          <ul>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				The secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions are respectively defined as the reciprocals of the cosine, sine, and tangent functions.  That is, 
  				<me>
  					\sec(t) = \frac{1}{\cos(t)}, \csc(t) = \frac{1}{\sin(t)}, \text{ and } \cot(t) = \frac{1}{\tan(t)}
  				</me>. 
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				The graph of the cotangent function is similar to the graph of the tangent function, except that it is decreasing on every interval on which it is defined at every point in the interval and has vertical asymptotes wherever <m>\tan(t) = 0</m> and is zero wherever <m>\tan(t)</m> has a vertical asymptote.
  			</p>

  			<p>
  				The graphs of the secant and cosecant functions are different from the cosine and sine functions' graphs in several ways, including that their range is the set of all real numbers <m>y</m> such that <m>y \ge 1</m> and they have vertical asymptotes wherever the cosine and sine function, respectively, are zero.
  			</p>
  		</li>
            <li>
  			<p>
  				A trigonometric identity is an equation involving trigonometric functions that is true for every value of the variable for which the trigonometric functions are defined.  For instance, <m>\tan^2(t) + 1 = \sec^2(t)</m> for every real number <m>t</m> except <m>t = \frac{\pi}{2} \pm k\pi</m>.  Identities offer us alternate perspectives on the same function.  For instance, the function <m>f(t) = \sec^2(t) - \tan^2(t)</m> is the same (at all points where <m>f</m> is defined) as the function whose value is always <m>1</m>.

      (a) Since <m>\csc{ ( \theta ) } = \frac{1}{\sin{ ( \theta )}}</m>, we begin by using the Pythagorean Identity to find <m>\sin{ ( \theta ) }</m>.  Since <m>\cos^2{ ( \theta )} + \sin^2{ ( \theta ) }=1</m>, we have

      Since <m>0 \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}</m>, <m>\sin{ ( \theta ) } \ge 0</m>, so

  				How can we use limit notation to succinctly express a function's behavior as the input increases without bound or as the function's value increases without bound?

  		</li><li>
  			<p>
  				What are some important limits and trends involving <m>\infty</m> that we can observe for familiar functions such as <m>e^x</m>, <m>\ln(x)</m>, <m>x^2</m>, and <m>\frac{1}{x}</m>?

  		</li><li>
  			<p>
  				What is a power function and how does the value of the power determine the function's overall behavior?
  			</p>
  		</li></ul>
  </objectives>
        <introduction>
          <p>
  		In <xref ref="sec-exp-modeling">Section</xref>, we compared the behavior of the exponential functions <m>p(t) = 2^t</m> and <m>q(t) = (\frac{1}{2})^t</m>, and observed in <xref ref="F-modeling-exp-reflection">Figure</xref> that as <m>t</m> increases without bound, <m>p(t)</m> also increases without bound, while <m>q(t)</m> approaches <m>0</m> (while having its value be always positive).  We also introduced shorthand notation for describing these phenomena, writing 
  		<me>
  			p(t) \to \infty \text{ as } t \to \infty
  		</me>
  		and 
  		<me>
  			q(t) \to 0 \text{ as } t \to \infty
  		</me>.
  		It's important to remember that infinity is not itself a number.  We use the <q><m>\infty</m></q> symbol to represent a quantity that gets larger and larger with no bound on its growth.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		We also know that the concept of infinity plays a key role in understanding the graphical behavior of functions.  For instance, we've seen that for a function such as <m>F(t) = 72 - 45e^{-0.05t}</m>, <m>F(t) \to 72</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>, since <m>e^{-0.05t} \to 0</m> as <m>t</m> increases without bound.  The function <m>F</m> can be viewed as modeling the temperature of an object that is initially <m>F(0) = 72-45 = 27</m> degrees that eventually warms to <m>72</m> degrees.  The line <m>y = 72</m> is thus a horizontal asymptote of the function <m>F</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		In <xref ref="PA-poly-infty">Preview</xref>, we review some familiar functions and portions of their behavior that involve <m>\infty</m>.

          <title>Limit notation</title>
          <p>
  		When observing a pattern in the values of a function that correspond to letting the inputs get closer and closer to a fixed value or letting the inputs increase or decrease without bound, we are often interested in the behavior of the function <q>in the limit</q>.  In either case, we are considering an infinite collection of inputs that are themselves following a pattern, and we ask the question <q>how can we expect the function's output to behave if we continue?</q>  
  	</p>
          <p>
  		For instance, we have regularly observed that <q>as <m>t \to \infty</m>, <m>e^{-t} \to 0</m>,</q> which means that by allowing <m>t</m> to get bigger and bigger without bound, we can make <m>e^{-t}</m> get as close to <m>0</m> as we'd like (without <m>e^{-t}</m> ever equalling <m>0</m>, since <m>e^{-t}</m> is always positive).
  	</p>
          <sidebyside width="50%">
            <figure xml:id="F-exp-reflection">
              <caption>Plots of <m>y = e^t</m> and <m>y = e^{-t}</m>.</caption>
              <image source="images/infty-exp-reflection"/>

            </figure>
          </sidebyside>
          <p>
  		Similarly, as seen in <xref ref="F-exp-reflection">Figure</xref> and <xref ref="F-exp-log">Figure</xref>, we can make such observations as <m>e^t \to \infty</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>, <m>\ln(t) \to \infty</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>, and <m>\ln(t) \to -\infty</m> as <m>t \to 0^+</m>.  We introduce formal <em>limit notation</em> in order to be able to express these patterns even more succinctly.

  				Let <m>L</m> be a real number and <m>f</m> be a function.  If we can make the value of <m>f(t)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we want by letting <m>t</m> increase without bound, we write
	  			<me>
	  				\lim_{t \to \infty} f(t) = L
	  			</me>
	  			and say that the <term>limit of <m>f</m> as <m>t</m> increases without bound is <m>L</m></term>.  
  			</p>
              <p>
  				If the value of <m>f(t)</m> increases without bound as <m>t</m> increases without bound, we instead write
	  			<me>
	  				\lim_{t \to \infty} f(t) = \infty
	  			</me>.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				Finally, if <m>f</m> doesn't increase without bound, doesn't decrease without bound, and doesn't approach a single value <m>L</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>, we say that <term><m>f</m> does not have a limit as <m>t \to \infty</m></term>.
  			</p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
  		We use limit notation in related, natural ways to express patterns we see in function behavior.  For instance, we write <m>t \to -\infty</m> when we let <m>t</m> decrease without bound, and <m>f(t) \to -\infty</m> if <m>f</m> decreases without bound.  We can also think about an input value <m>t</m> approaching a value <m>a</m> at which the function <m>f</m> is not defined.  As one example, we write
  		<me>
  			\lim_{t \to 0^+} \ln(t) = -\infty
  		</me>
  		because the natural logarithm function decreases without bound as input values get closer and close to <m>0</m> (while always being positive), as seen in <xref ref="F-exp-log">Figure</xref>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		In the situation where <m>\lim_{t \to \infty} f(t) = L</m>, this tells us that <m>f</m> has a horizontal asymptote <idx><h>horizontal asymptote</h></idx> at <m>y = L</m> since the function's value approaches this fixed number as <m>t</m> increases without bound.  Similarly, if we can say that <m>\lim_{t \to a} f(t) = \infty</m>, this shows that <m>f</m> has a vertical asymptote <idx><h>vertical asymptote</h></idx> at <m>x = a</m> since the function's value increases without bound as inputs approach the fixed number <m>a</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		For now, we are going to focus on the long-range behavior of certain basic, familiar functions and work to understand how they behave as the input increases or decreases without bound.  Above we've used the input variable <m>t</m> in most of our previous work; going forward, we'll regularly use <m>x</m> as well.

          <title>Power functions</title>
          <p>
  		To date, we have worked with several families of functions:
	    linear functions of form <m>y = mx + b</m>,
	    quadratic functions in standard form, <m>y = ax^2 + bx + c</m>,
	    the sinusoidal (trigonometric) functions <m>y = a\sin(k(x-b))+c</m> or <m>y = a\cos(k(x-b))+c</m>,
	    transformed exponential functions such as <m>y = ae^{kx} + c</m>,
	    and transformed logarithmic functions of form <m>y = a\ln(x) + c</m>.  For trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, it was essential that we first understood the behavior of the basic parent functions <m>\sin(x)</m>, <m>\cos(x)</m>, <m>e^x</m>, and <m>\ln(x)</m>.  In order to build on our prior work with linear and quadratic functions, we now consider basic functions such as <m>x</m>, <m>x^2</m>, and additional powers of <m>x</m>.

          <p>
		In the situation where the power <m>p</m> is a negative integer (i.e., a negative whole number), power functions behave very differently.  This is because of the property of exponents that states
		<me>
			x^{-n} = \frac{1}{x^n}
		</me>
		so for a power function such as <m>p(x) = x^{-2}</m>, we can equivalently consider <m>p(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}</m>.  Note well that for these functions, their domain is the set of all real numbers except <m>x = 0</m>.  Like with power functions with positive whole number powers, we want to know how power functions with negative whole number powers behave as <m>x</m> increases without bound, as well as how the functions behave near <m>x = 0</m>.

  				The notation
  				<me>
  					\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L
  				</me>
  				means that we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we'd like by letting <m>x</m> be sufficiently large.  This indicates that the value of <m>f</m> eventually stops changing much and tends to a single value, and thus <m>y = L</m> is a horizontal asymptote of the function <m>f</m>.

  			<p>
  				Similarly, the notation
  				<me>
  					\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty
  				</me>
  				means that we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we'd like by letting <m>x</m> be sufficiently close, but not equal, to <m>a</m>.  This unbounded behavior of <m>f</m> near a finite value <m>a</m> indicates that <m>f</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x = a</m>.

  				A power function is a function of the form <m>f(x) = x^p</m> where <m>p</m> is any real number.  For the two cases where <m>p</m> is a positive whole number or a negative whole number, it is straightforward to summarize key trends in power functions' behavior.
  			</p>

  			<p>
  				<ul><li>
  						<p>
  							If <m>p = 1, 2, 3, \ldots</m>, then the domain of <m>f(x) = x^p</m> is the set of all real numbers, and as <m>x \to \infty</m>, <m>f(x) \to \infty</m>.  For the limit as <m>x \to -\infty</m>, it matters whether <m>p</m> is even or odd:  if <m>p</m> is even, <m>f(x) \to \infty</m> as <m>x \to -\infty</m>; if <m>p</m> is odd, <m>f(x) \to -\infty</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>.  Informally, all power functions of form <m>f(x) = x^p</m> where <m>p</m> is a positive even number are <q>U-shaped</q>, while all power functions of form <m>f(x) = x^p</m> where <m>p</m> is a positive odd number are <q>chair-shaped</q>.
  						</p>
  					</li><li>
  						<p>
  							If <m>p = -1, -2, -3, \ldots</m>, then the domain of <m>f(x) = x^p</m> is the set of all real numbers <em>except</em> <m>x=0</m>, and as <m>x \to \pm \infty</m>, <m>f(x) \to 0</m>.  This means that each such power function with a negative whole number exponent has a horizontal asymptote of <m>y = 0</m>.  Regardless of the value of <m>p</m> (<m>p = -1, -2, -3, \ldots</m>), <m>\lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x) = \infty</m>.  But when we approach <m>0</m> from the negative side, it matters whether <m>p</m> is even or odd:  if <m>p</m> is even, <m>f(x) \to \infty</m> as <m>x \to 0^-</m>; if <m>p</m> is odd, <m>f(x) \to -\infty</m> as <m>x \to 0^-</m>.  Informally, all power functions of form <m>f(x) = x^p</m> where <m>p</m> is a negative odd number look similar to <m>\frac{1}{x}</m>, while all power functions of form <m>f(x) = x^p</m> where <m>p</m> is a negative even number look similar to <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m>.

        We've observed that several different familiar functions grow without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>, including <m>f(x) = \ln(x)</m>, <m>g(x) = x^2</m>, and <m>h(x) = e^x</m>.  In this exercise, we compare and contrast how these three functions grow.

  		We know that linear functions are the simplest of all functions we can consider:  their graphs have the simplest shape, their average rate of change is always constant (regardless of the interval chosen), and their formula is elementary.  Moreover, computing the value of a linear function only requires multiplication and addition.
  	</p>
          <p>
		If we think of a linear function as having formula <m>L(x) = b + mx</m>, and the next-simplest functions, quadratic functions, as having form <m>Q(x) = c + bx + ax^2</m>, we can see immediate parallels between their respective forms and realize that it's natural to consider slightly more complicated functions by adding additional power functions.
	</p>
          <p>
		Indeed, if we instead view linear functions as having form
	    <me>
	      L(x) = a_0 + a_1 x
	    </me>
	    (for some constants <m>a_0</m> and <m>a_1</m>) and quadratic functions as having form
	    <me>
	      Q(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2
	    </me>
      (for some constants <m>a_0</m>, <m>a_1</m>, and <m>a_2</m>),
	    then it's natural to think about more general functions of this same form,
	    but with additional power functions included.

	    Since a polynomial is simply a sum of constant multiples of various power functions with positive integer powers, we often refer to those individual terms by referring to their individual degrees:  the linear term, the quadratic term, and so on.  In addition, since the domain of any power function of the form <m>p(x) = x^n</m> where <m>n</m> is a positive whole number is the set of all real numbers, it's also true the the domain of any polynomial function is the set of all real numbers.

  		Our observations in <xref ref="PA-poly-polynomials">Preview Activity</xref> generalize to polynomials of any degree.  In particular, it is possible to prove the following general conclusions regarding the number of zeros, the long-range behavior, and the number of turning points any polynomial of degree <m>n</m>.

  		<title>The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>
 		<p>
 			For any degree <m>n</m> polynomial <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_n x^n</m>, has at most <m>n</m> real zeros.<fn>We can actually say even more:  if we allow the zeros to be complex numbers, then every degree <m>n</m> polynomial has <em>exactly</em> <m>n</m> zeros, provided we count zeros according to their multiplicity.  For example, the polynomial <m>p(x) = (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1</m> because it has a zero of multiplicity two at <m>x = 1</m>.</fn>

          <p>
  		We know that each of the power functions <m>x</m>, <m>x^2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x^n</m> grow without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>.  Intuitively, we sense that <m>x^5</m> grows faster than <m>x^4</m> (and likewise for any comparison of a higher power to a lower one).  This means that for large values of <m>x</m>, the most important term in any polynomial is its highest order term, as we saw in <xref ref="PA-poly-polynomials">Preview Activity</xref> when we compared <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4</m> and <m>y = a_4 x^4</m>.

  		<title>The long-range behavior of a polynomial</title>
 		<p>
 			For any degree <m>n</m> polynomial <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_n x^n</m>, its long-range behavior is the same as its highest-order term <m>q(x) = a_n x^n</m>.  Thus, any polynomial of even degree appears <q>U-shaped</q> (<m>\cup</m> or <m>\cap</m>, like <m>x^2</m> or <m>-x^2</m>) when we zoom way out, and any polynomial of odd degree appears <q>chair-shaped</q> (like <m>x^3</m> or <m>-x^3</m>) when we zoom way out.

		Finally, a key idea from calculus justifies the fact that the maximum number of turning points of a degree <m>n</m> polynomial is <m>n-1</m>, as we conjectured in the degree <m>4</m> case in <xref ref="PA-poly-polynomials">Preview Activity</xref>.  Moreover, the only possible numbers of turning points must have the same parity as <m>n-1</m>; that is, if <m>n-1</m> is even, then the number of turning points must be even, and if instead <m>n-1</m> is odd, the number of turning points must also be odd.  For instance, for the degree <m>7</m> polynomial in <xref ref="F-poly-degree-7-near">Figure</xref>, we know that it is chair-shaped, with one end up and one end down.  There could be zero turning points and the function could always decrease.  But if there is at least one, then there must be a second, since if there were only one the function would decrease and then increase without turning back, which would force the graph to appear U-shaped.

          <title>Using zeros and signs to understand polynomial behavior</title>
          <p>
  		Just like a quadratic function can be written in different forms (standard: <m>q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</m>, vertex: <m>q(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k</m>, and factored: <m>q(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)</m>), it's possible to write a polynomial function in different forms and to gain information about its behavior from those different forms.  In particular, if we know all of the zeros of a polynomial function, we can write its formula in factored form, which gives us a deeper understanding of its graph.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		The Zero Product Property <idx><h>Zero Product Property</h></idx> states that if two or more numbers are multiplied together and the result is <m>0</m>, then at least one of the numbers must be <m>0</m>.  We use the Zero Product Property regularly with polynomial functions.  If we can determine all <m>n</m> zeros of a degree <m>n</m> polynomial, and we call those zeros <m>r_1</m>, <m>r_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>r_n</m>, we can write 
  		<me>
  			p(x) = a_n(x-r_1)(x-r_2) \cdots (x-r_2)
  		</me>.  
  		Moreover, if we are given a polynomial in this factored form, we can quickly determine its zeros.  For instance, if <m>p(x) = 2(x+7)(x+1)(x-2)(x-5)</m>, we know that the only way <m>p(x) = 0</m> is if at least one of the factors <m>(x+7)</m>, <m>(x+1)</m>, <m>(x-2)</m>, or <m>(x-5)</m> equals <m>0</m>, which implies that <m>x = -7</m>, <m>x = -1</m>, <m>x = 2</m>, or <m>x = 5</m>.  Hence, from the factored form of a polynomial, it is straightforward to identify the polynomial's zeros, the <m>x</m>-values at which its graph crosses the <m>x</m>-axis.  We can also use the factored form of a polynomial to develop what we call a <em>sign chart</em>, which we demonstrate in <xref ref="ex-polynomial-signs">Example</xref>. <idx><h>sign chart</h></idx> 
  	</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-polynomial-signs">
            <statement>
              <p>
  				Consider the polynomial function <m>p(x) = k(x-1)(x-a)(x-b)</m>.  Suppose we know that <m>1 \lt a \lt b</m> and that <m>k \lt 0</m>.  Fully describe the graph of <m>p</m> without the aid of a graphing utility.
  			</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
  				Since <m>p(x) = k(x-1)(x-a)(x-b)</m>, we immediately know that <m>p</m> is a degree <m>3</m> polynomial with <m>3</m> real zeros:  <m>x = 1, a, b</m>.  We are given that <m>1 \lt a \lt b</m> and in addition that <m>k \lt 0</m>.  If we expand the factored form of <m>p(x)</m>, it has form <m>p(x) = kx^3 + \cdots</m>, and since we know that when we zoom out, <m>p(x)</m> behaves like <m>kx^3</m>, we know that with <m>k \lt 0</m> it follows <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} p(x) = +\infty</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} p(x) = -\infty</m>.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				Since <m>p</m> is degree <m>3</m> and we know it has zeros at <m>x = 1, a, b,</m> we know there are no other locations where <m>p(x) = 0</m>.  Thus, on any interval between two zeros (or to the left of the least or the right of the greatest), the polynomial cannot change sign.  We now investigate, interval by interval, the sign of the function.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				When <m>x \lt 1</m>, it follows that <m>x - 1 \lt 0</m>.  In addition, since <m>1 \lt a \lt b</m>, when <m>x \lt 1</m>, <m>x</m> lies to the left of <m>1</m>, <m>a</m>, and <m>b</m>, which also makes <m>x-a</m> and <m>x-b</m> negative.  Moreover, we know that the constant <m>k \lt 0</m>.  Hence, on the interval <m>x \lt 1</m>, all four terms in <m>p(x) = k(x-1)(x-a)(x-b)</m> are negative, which we indicate by writing <q><m>----</m></q> in that location on the sign chart pictured in <xref ref="F-polynomial-sign-chart-1">Figure</xref>.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				In addition, since there are an even number of negative terms in the product, the overall product's sign is positive, which we indicate by the single <q><m>+</m></q> beneath <q><m>----</m></q>, and by writing <q>POS</q> below the coordinate axis.
  			</p>
              <figure xml:id="F-polynomial-sign-chart-1">
                <caption>A sign chart for the polynomial function <m>p(x) = k(x-1)(x-a)(x-b)</m>.</caption>
                <image source="images/polynomial-sign-chart-1" width="80%"/>
              </figure>
              <p>
  				We now proceed to the other intervals created by the zeros.  On <m>1 \lt x \lt a</m>, the term <m>(x-1)</m> has become positive, since <m>x \gt 1</m>.  But both <m>x-a</m> and <m>x-b</m> are negative, as is the constant <m>k</m>, and thus we write <q><m>-+--</m></q> for this interval, which has overall sign <q><m>-</m></q>, as noted in the figure.  Similar reasoning completes the diagram.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				From all of the information we have deduced about <m>p</m>, we conclude that regardless of the locations of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, the graph of <m>p</m> must look like the curve shown in <xref ref="F-polynomial-sign-chart-1-graph">Figure</xref>.

          <title>Multiplicity of polynomial zeros</title>
          <p>
  		In <xref ref="act-poly-polynomials-sign-chart">Activity</xref>, we found that one of the zeros of the polynomial <m>p(x) = 4692(x + 1520)(x^2 + 10000)(x - 3471)^2 (x - 9738)</m> leads to different behavior of the function near that zero than we've seen in other situations.  We now consider the more general situation where a polynomial has a repeated factor of the form <m>(x-r)^n</m>.  When <m>(x-r)^n</m> is a factor of a polynomial <m>p</m>, we say that <m>p</m> has a <term>zero of multiplicity <m>n</m></term> at <m>x = r</m>.  <idx><h>polynomial</h><h>zero of multiplicity <m>n</m></h></idx>
  	</p>
          <p>
  		To see the impact of repeated factors, we examine a collection of degree <m>4</m> polynomials that each have <m>4</m> real zeros.  We start with the simplest of all, the function <m>f(x) = x^4</m>, whose zeros are <m>x = 0, 0, 0, 0</m>.  Because the factor <q><m>x-0</m></q> is repeated <m>4</m> times, the zero <m>x = 0</m> has multiplicity <m>4</m>. 
  	</p>
          <p>
  		Next we consider the degree <m>4</m> polynomial <m>g(x) = x^3 (x-1)</m>, which has a zero of multiplicity <m>3</m> at <m>x = 0</m> and a zero of multiplicity <m>1</m> at <m>x = 1</m>.
  	</p>
          <figure xml:id="F-polynomial-4A">
            <caption>A plot of <m>g(x) = x^3(x-1)</m> with zero <m>x = 0</m> of multiplicity <m>3</m> and <m>x = 1</m> of multiplicity <m>1</m>.</caption>
            <image source="images/polynomial-3-1" width="50%"/>
          </figure>
          <p>
		Observe that in <xref ref="F-polynomial-4A-mult-3">Figure</xref>, the up-close plot near the zero <m>x = 0</m> of multiplicity <m>3</m>, the polynomial function <m>g</m> looks similar to the basic cubic polynomial <m>-x^3</m>.  In addition, in <xref ref="F-polynomial-4A-mult-1">Figure</xref>, we observe that if we zoom in even futher on the zero of multiplicity <m>1</m>, the function <m>g</m> looks roughly linear, like a degree <m>1</m> polynomial.  This type of behavior near repeated zeros turns out to hold in other cases as well.

Thus, <m>p</m> is chair-shaped if <m>n</m> is odd and U-shaped if <m>n</m> is even.  Whether <m>\lim_{n \to \infty} p(x)</m> is <m>+\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m> depends on the sign of <m>a_n</m>.
  					</p>
  				</li><li>
  					<p>
  						If the function is in factored form, say <me>p(x) = a_n(x-r_1)(x-r_2) \cdots (x-r_n)</me> (where the <m>r_i</m>'s are possibly not distinct and possibly complex), we can quickly determine both the degree of the polynomial (<m>n</m>) and the locations of its zeros, as well as their multiplicities.
  					</p>
  				</li></ul>
                        </p>
  		</li><li>
  			<p>
  				A sign chart is a visual way to identify all of the locations where a function is zero along with the sign of the function on the various intervals the zeros create.  A sign chart gives us an overall sense of the graph of the function, but without concerning ourselves with any specific values of the function besides the zeros.  For a sample sign chart, see <xref ref="F-polynomial-sign-chart-1">Figure</xref>.
  			</p>
  		</li><li>
  			<p>
  				When a polynomial <m>p</m> has a repeated factor such as <me>p(x) = (x-5)(x-5)(x-5) = (x-5)^3</me>, we say that <m>x = 5</m> is a zero of multiplicity <m>3</m>.  At the point <m>x = 5</m> where <m>p</m> will cross the <m>x</m>-axis, up close it will look like a cubic polynomial and thus be chair-shaped.  In general, if <m>(x-r)^n</m> is a factor of a polynomial <m>p</m> so that <m>x = r</m> is a zero of multiplicity <m>n</m>, the polynomial will behave near <m>x = r</m> like the polynomial <m>x^n</m> behaves near <m>x = 0</m>.

        <title>Modeling with polynomial functions</title>

  			<p>
  				Why do polynomials arise naturally in the study of problems involving the volume and surface area of three-dimensional containers such as boxes and cylinders?
  			</p>
  		</li><li>
        <p>
          How can polynomial functions be used to approximate non-polynomial curves and functions?
        </p>
      </li></ul>
  </objectives>
        <introduction>
          <p>
  		Polynomial functions are the simplest of all functions in mathematics in part because they only involve multiplication and addition.  In any applied setting where we can formulate key ideas using only those arithmetic operations, it's natural that polynomial functions model the corresponding phenomena.  For example, in <xref ref="act-changing-functions-spherical-tank">Activity</xref>, we saw that for a spherical tank of radius <m>4</m> m filling with water, the volume of water in the tank at a given instant, <m>V</m>, is a function of the depth, <m>h</m>, of the water in the tank at the same moment according to the formula
  		<me>
        	V = f(h) = \frac{\pi}{3} h^2(12-h)
      	</me>.
      	The function <m>f</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>3</m> with a repeated zero at <m>h = 0</m> and an additional zero at <m>h = 12</m>.  Because the tank has a radius of <m>4</m>, its total height is <m>h</m>, and thus the model <m>V = f(h) = \frac{\pi}{3} h^2(12-h)</m> is only valid on the domain <m>0 \le h \le 8</m>.  This polynomial function tells us how the volume of water in the tank changes as <m>h</m> changes.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		In other similar situations where we consider the volume of a box, tank, or other three-dimensional container, polynomial functions frequently arise.  To develop a model function that represents a physical situation, we almost always begin by drawing one or more diagrams of the situation and then introduce one or more variables to represent quantities that are changing.  From there, we explore relationships that are present and work to express one of the quantities in terms of the other(s).
  	</p>

          <title>Volume, surface area, and constraints</title>
          <p>
  		In <xref ref="PA-poly-polynomial-applications">Preview Activity</xref>, we worked with a rectangular box being built by folding cardboard.  One of the key principles we needed to use was the fact that the volume of a rectangular box of length <m>l</m>, width <m>w</m>, and height <m>h</m> is
      <men xml:id="eq-polynomial-applications-volume-box">
        V = lwh
      </men>.  <idx><h>rectangular box</h><h>volume</h></idx>  <idx><h>volume</h><h>box</h></idx>
    </p>
          <sidebyside valign="bottom">
            <figure xml:id="F-polynomial-applications-box">
              <caption>A rectangular box.</caption>
              <image source="images/polynomial-applications-box"/>
            </figure>
            <figure xml:id="F-polynomial-applications-cylinder">
              <caption>A circular cylinder.</caption>
              <image source="images/polynomial-applications-cylinder"/>
            </figure>
          </sidebyside>
          <p>
      One way to remember the formula for the area of a rectangular box is <q>area of the base times the height</q>.  This principle extends to other three-dimensional shapes that have constant cross-sectional area.  For instance, the volume of a circular cylinder with radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m> is
      <men xml:id="eq-polynomial-applications-volume-cylinder">
        V = \pi r^2 h
      </men> <idx><h>circular cylinder</h><h>volume</h></idx>  <idx><h>volume</h><h>cylinder</h></idx>
      since the area of the base is <m>\pi r^2</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
      We'll also often consider the surface area of a three-dimensional container.  For a rectangular box with side lengths of <m>l</m>, <m>w</m>, and <m>h</m>, its surface area consists of <m>3</m> pairs of rectangles:  the top and bottom, each of area <m>lw</m>, the two sides that are the front and back when we look right at the box, each of area <m>lh</m>, and the remaining two sides of area <m>wh</m>.  Thus the total surface area of the box is 
      <men xml:id="eq-polynomial-applications-SA-box"> <idx><h>rectangular box</h><h>surface area</h></idx>  <idx><h>surface area</h><h>box</h></idx>
        SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh
      </men>.  
      For a circular cylinder, its surface area is the sum of the areas of the top and bottom (<m>\pi r^2</m> each), plus the area of the <q>sides</q>.  If we think of cutting the cylinder vertically and unfurling it, the resulting figure is a rectangle whose dimensions are the height of the cylinder, <m>h</m>, by the circumference of the base, <m>2\pi r</m>.  The rectangle's area is therefore <m>2\pi r \cdot h</m>, and hence the total surface area of a cylinder is
      <men xml:id="eq-polynomial-applications-SA-cylinder">
        SA = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h
      </men>. <idx><h>circular cylinder</h><h>surface area</h></idx> <idx><h>surface area</h><h>cylinder</h></idx>
    </p>
          <p>
      Each of the volume and surface area equations (<xref ref="eq-polynomial-applications-volume-box">Equation</xref>, <xref ref="eq-polynomial-applications-volume-cylinder">Equation</xref>, <xref ref="eq-polynomial-applications-SA-box">Equation</xref>, and <xref ref="eq-polynomial-applications-SA-cylinder">Equation</xref>) involve only multiplication and addition, and thus have the potential to result in polynomial functions.  At present, however, each of these equations involves at least two variables.  The inclusion of additional constraints can enable us to use these formulas to generate polynomial functions of a single variable.

          <title>Other applications of polynomial functions</title>
          <p>
      A different use of polynomial functions arises with <em>Bezier curves</em>.  <idx><h>Bezier curves</h></idx>  The most common type of Bezier curve used in applications is the cubic Bezier curve, which is a curve given parametrically by a formula of the form <m>(x(t), y(t))</m>, where
      <me>
        x(t) = (1-t)^3 x_0 + 3(1-t^2)t x_1 + 3(1-t^2)t x_2 + t^3 x_3
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        y(t) = (1-t)^3 y_0 + 3(1-t^2)t y_1 + 3(1-t)t^2 y_2 + t^3 y_3 )
      </me>.
      The curve passes through the points <m>A = (x_0,y_0)</m> and <m>B = (x_3, y_3)</m> and the points <m>C = (x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>D = (x_2, y_2)</m> are called <em>control points</em>.  At <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0zC">http://gvsu.edu/s/0zC</url>, you can explore the effects of moving the control points (in gray) and the points on the curve (in black) to generate different curves in the plane, similar to the one shown in <xref ref="F-polynomial-applications-Bezier">Figure</xref>.

          <p>
      The main issue to realize is that the form of the curve depends on a special family of cubic polynomials:
      <me>
        (1-t)^3, 3(1-t^2)t, 3(1-t^2)t, \ \text{ and } \ t^3
      </me>.
      These four cubic polynomials play a key role in graphic design and are used in all sorts of important ways, including in font design, as seen in <xref ref="F-polynomial-applications-Bezier-letter">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Another important application of polynomial functions is found in how they can be used to approximate the sine and cosine functions.

          Polynomials arise naturally in the study of problems involving the volume and surface area of three-dimensional containers such as boxes and cylinders because these formulas fundamentally involve sums and products of variables.  For instance, the volume of a cylinder is <m>V = \pi r^2 h</m>.  In the presence of a surface area constraint that tells us that <m>h = \frac{100-2\pi r^2}{2\pi r}</m>, it follows that 
          <me>
            V = \pi r^2 \frac{100-2\pi r^2}{2\pi r} = r(50-\pi r^2)
          </me>,
          which is a cubic polynomial.

          Polynomial functions be used to approximate non-polynomial curves and functions in many different ways.  One example is found in cubic Bezier curves which use a collection of <em>control points</em> to enable the user to manipulate curves to pass through select points in such a way that the curve first travels in a certain direction.  Another example is in the remarkable approximation of non-polynomial functions like the sine function, as given by
          <me>
            \sin(x) \approx x - \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{5!}x^5 - \frac{1}{7!}x^7 
          </me>,
          where the approximation is good for <m>x</m>-values near <m>x = 0</m>.

      <answer><p><m>4x^{2}+9x+3</m></p></answer>
      
      <solution><alert>  SOLUTION </alert>
      
      
      
      Let <m>M</m> be the amount of packing material you will need, then 
      
      
      <m>M = \left( \mbox{Volume of crate} \right) -\left( \hbox{ Volume of box} \right) = V_c-V_b</m>
      where <m>V_c</m> and <m>V_b</m> are the volumes of the crate and box, respectively. We have for the box's volume, <m>V_b = x(x+ 2)(x-1)</m>.
      
      
      
      The wooden crate must be <m>1</m> ft longer than the cardboard box, so
      its length is <m>(x + 1)</m>. This gives the required <m>0.5</m> ft clearance
      between the crate and the front and back of the box.  Similarly, the
      crate's width must be <m>1</m> ft greater than the box's width of <m>(x + 2)</m>, and its depth must be 2 ft greater than the box's depth of <m>(x-1)</m>.
      
      
      
      We have for the crate's volume
      <me>V_c = (x+1)(x+2+1)(x-1+2) = (x+1)(x+3)(x+1).</me>
      Thus, the total amount of packing material will be
      <me>M = V_c - V_b = (x+1)(x+3)(x+1)-x(x+2)(x-1).</me>
      
      
      
      The formula for <m>M</m> is a difference of two third-degree polynomials.
      The format is not terribly convenient, so we simplify the
      formula by multiplying the factors for <m>V_b</m> and <m>V_c</m> and gathering
      like terms.  Then for <m>M</m> we have
      <me>\begin{aligned}
      M \amp = (x+1)(x+3)(x+1)-x(x+2)(x-1) \\
      \amp = ( x^3 + 5 x^2 + 7 x + 3 )-( x^3 + 1 x^2  - 2 x) \\
      \amp = 4 x^2 + 9 x + 3.
      \end{aligned}</me></solution>

        <introduction>
          <p>
			The average rate of change of a function on an interval always involves a ratio.  Indeed, for a given function <m>f</m> that interests us near <m>t = 2</m>, we can investigate its average rate of change on intervals near this value by considering
			<me>
				AV_{[2,2+h]} = \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}
			</me>.
			Suppose, for instance, that <m>f</m> meausures the height of a falling ball at time <m>t</m> and is given by <m>f(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 48</m>, which happens to be a polynomial function of degree <m>2</m>.  For this particular function, its average rate of change on <m>[1,1+h]</m> is
			<md><mrow>
					AV_{[2,2+h]} &amp;= \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}
				</mrow><mrow>
						 &amp;= \frac{-16(2+h)^2 + 32(2+h) + 48 - (-16 \cdot 4 + 32 \cdot 2 + 48)}{h}
				</mrow><mrow>
						 &amp;= \frac{-64 - 64h - 16h^2 + 64 + 32h + 48 - (48)}{h}
				</mrow><mrow>
						 &amp;= \frac{-64h - 16h^2}{h}
				</mrow></md>.
			Structurally, we observe that <m>AV_{[2,2+h]}</m> is a ratio of the two functions <m>-64h - 16h^2</m> and <m>h</m>.  Moreover, both the numerator and the denominator of the expression are themselves polynomial functions of the variable <m>h</m>.  Note that we may be especially interested in what occurs as <m>h \to 0</m>, as these values will tell us the average velocity of the moving ball on shorter and shorter time intervals starting at <m>t = 2</m>.  At the same time, <m>AV_{[2,2+h]}</m> is not defined for <m>h = 0</m>.
		</p>
          <p>
			Ratios of polynomial functions arise in several different important circumstances.  Sometimes we are interested in what happens when the denominator approaches <m>0</m>, which makes the overall ratio undefined.  In other situations, we may want to know what happens in the long term and thus consider what happens when the input variable increases without bound.

			Long-range behavior of rational functions
		</title>
          <p>
			The functions <m>AV_{[2,2+h]} = \frac{-64h - 16h^2}{h}</m> and <m>A(q) = \frac{5000000 + 2500q}{q}</m> are both examples of rational functions, since each is a ratio of polynomial functions.  Formally, we have the following definition.
		</p>
          <definition xml:id="def-rational-function">
            <idx>
              <h>rational function</h>
            </idx>
            <statement>
              <p>
					A function <m>r</m> is <term>rational</term> provided that it is possible to write <m>r</m> as the ratio of two polynomials, <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>. That is, <m>r</m> is rational provided that for some polynomial functions <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>, we have
				    <me>
				      r(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}
				    </me>.
 				</p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
			Like with polynomial functions, we are interested in such natural questions as 
			<ul><li>
					<p>
						What is the long range behavior of a given rational function?
					</p>
				</li><li>
					<p>
						What is the domain of a given rational function?
					</p>
				</li><li>
					<p>
						How can we determine where a given rational function's value is <m>0</m>?
					</p>
				</li></ul>
		</p>
          <p>
			We begin by focusing on the long-range behavior of rational functions.  It's important first to recall our earlier work with power functions of the form <m>p(x) = x^{-n}</m> where <m>n = 1, 2, \ldots</m>.  For such functions, we know that <m>p(x) = \frac{1}{x^n}</m> where <m>n \gt 0</m> and that
			<me>
				\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x^n} = 0
			</me>
			since <m>x^n</m> increases without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>.  The same is true when <m>x \to -\infty</m>:  <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{1}{x^n} = 0</m>. Thus, any time we encounter a quantity such as <m>\frac{1}{x^3}</m>, this quantity will approach <m>0</m> as <m>x</m> increases without bound, and this will also occur for any constant numerator.  For instance,
			<me>
				\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2500}{x^2} = 0
			</me>
			since <m>2500</m> times a quantity approaching <m>0</m> will still approach <m>0</m> as <m>x</m> increases.

          <title>The domain of a rational function</title>
          <p>
			Because a rational function can be written in the form <m>r(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m> for some polynomial functions <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>, we have to be concerned about the possibility that a rational function's denominator is zero.

	 			Let <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> be polynomial functions so that <m>r(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m> is a rational function.  The domain of <m>r</m> is the set of all real numbers except those for which <m>q(x) = 0</m>.

            <solution>
              <p>
	  				To find the domain of any rational function, we need to determine where the denominator is zero.  The best way to find these values exactly is to factor the denominator.  Thus, we observe that

          <title>Applications of rational functions</title>
          <p>
			Rational functions arise naturally in the study of the average rate of change of a polynomial function, leading to expressions such as
			<me>
				AV_{[2,2+h]} = \frac{-64h - 16h^2}{h}
			</me>.  
			We will study several subtle issues that correspond to such functions further in <xref ref="sec-poly-rational-features">Section</xref>.  For now, we will focus on a different setting in which rational functions play a key role.
		</p>
          <p>
			In <xref ref="sec-poly-polynomial-applications">Section</xref>, we encountered a class of problems where a key quantity was modeled by a polynomial function.  We found that if we considered a container such as a cylinder with fixed surface area, then the volume of the container could be written as a polynomial of a single variable.  For instance, if we consider a circular cylinder with surface area <m>10</m> square feet, then we know that
			<me>
				S = 10 = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h
			</me>
			and therefore <m>h = \frac{10 - 2\pi r^2}{2 \pi r}</m>.  Since the cylinder's volume is <m>V = \pi r^2 h</m>, it follows that
			<me>
				V = \pi r^2 h = \pi r^2 \left( \frac{10 - 2\pi r^2}{2 \pi r} \right) = r(10 - 2\pi r^2)
			</me>,
			which is a polynomial function of <m>r</m>.
		</p>
          <p>
			What happens if we instead fix the volume of the container and ask about how surface area can be written as a function of a single variable?
		</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-rational-application-cylinder">
            <statement>
              <p>
					Suppose we want to construct a circular cylinder that holds <m>20</m> cubic feet of volume.  How much material does it take to build the container?  How can we state the amount of material as a function of a single variable?
				</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
					Neglecting any scrap, the amount of material it takes to construct the container is its surface area, which we know to be 
					<me>
						S = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h
					</me>.
					Because we want the volume to be fixed, this results in a constraint equation that enables us to relate <m>r</m> and <m>h</m>.  In particular, since
					<me>
						V = 20 = \pi r^2 h
					</me>,
					it follows that we can solve for <m>h</m> and get <m>h = \frac{20}{\pi r^2}</m>.  Substituting this expression for <m>h</m> in the equation for surface area, we find that
					<me>
						S = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r \cdot \frac{20}{\pi r^2} = 2 \pi r^2 + \frac{40}{r}
					</me>.
					Getting a common denominator, we can also write <m>S</m> in the form
					<me>
						S(r) = \frac{2 \pi r^3 + 40}{r}
					</me>
					and thus we see that <m>S</m> is a rational function of <m>r</m>.  Because of the physical context of the problem and the fact that the denominator of <m>S</m> is <m>r</m>, the domain of <m>S</m> is the set of all positive real numbers.

			Suppose that we want to build an open rectangular box (that is, without a top) that holds <m>15</m> cubic feet of volume.  If we want one side of the base to be twice as long as the other, how does the amount of material required depend on the shorter side of the base?  We investigate this question through the following sequence of prompts.

          <title>Summary</title>
          <ul>
            <li>
				<p>
					A rational function is a function whose formula can be written as the ratio of two polynomial functions.  For instance, <m>r(x) = \frac{7x^3 - 5x + 16}{-4x^4 + 2x^3 - 11x + 3}</m> is a rational function.
				</p>
			</li>
            <li>
				<p>
					Two aspects of rational functions are straightforward to determine for any rational function.  Given <m>r(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m> where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are polynomials, the domain of <m>r</m> is the set of all real numbers except any values of <m>x</m> for which <m>q(x) = 0</m>.  In addition, we can determine the long-range behavior of <m>r</m> by examining the highest order terms in <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>:

					<ul><li>
							<p>
								if the degree of <m>p</m> is less than the degree of <m>q</m>, then <m>r</m> has a horizontal asymptote at <m>y = 0</m>;
							</p>
						</li><li>
							<p>
								if the degree of <m>p</m> equals the degree of <m>q</m>, then <m>r</m> has a horizontal asymptote at <m>y = \frac{a_n}{b_n}</m>, where <m>a_n</m> and <m>b_n</m> are the leading coefficients of <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> respectively;
							</p>
						</li><li>
							<p>
								and if the degree of <m>p</m> is greater than the degree of <m>q</m>, then <m>r</m> does not have a horizontal asymptote.
							</p>
						</li></ul>
				</p>
			</li>
            <li>
				<p>
					Two reasons that rational functions are important are that they arise naturally when we consider the average rate of change on an interval whose length varies and when we consider problems that relate the volume and surface area of three-dimensional containers when one of those two quantities is constrained.

      Note that <m>\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{x^2-16}{-x^3 - 16 x^2} = \frac{(x-4)(x+4)}{-x^2(x+16)}</m>.  The <m>x</m>-intercepts occur when <m>y = 0</m>.  This will be when <m>x = \pm 4</m>.  The <m>y</m>-intercepts are when <m>x = 0</m>, but this makes the function undefined, so there are no <m>y</m> intercepts.  Then, vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator goes to zero.  This occurs when <m>x = 0</m> or <m>x = -4</m>.  Finally, a horizontal asymptote is seen as <m>x\to\pm\infty</m> if <m>f(x)</m> has a limiting value there.  In this case, as <m>x\to\pm\infty</m>, we see that the denominator grows as <m>x^3</m> while the numerator grows as <m>x^2</m>.  Thus <m>f(x)\to 0</m>, and this is the horizontal asymptote.

      (a) The graph shows <m>y= 1/x</m> shifted to
      the left 5 and down 2 units. Thus,
      <me>y = \frac{1}{x + 5} - 2</me>
      is a choice for a formula.
      
      
      
      
      (b) The equation
      <me>y = \frac{1}{x + 5} - 2 = \frac{ -2 x  - 9}{x+5}.</me>
      
      
      
      
      (c) We see that the graph has both an <m>x</m>-and
      <m>y</m>-intercept.
      If <m>y=0</m> then <m>-2 x - 9=0</m>, so <m>x= -\frac{9}{2}</m>.
      The <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>\left( -\frac{9}{2}, 0 \right)</m>.
      
      
      
      When <m>x=0</m>,
      <me>y= f(0) = \frac{ -2 (0)  - 9}{0+5} = \frac{-9}{5},</me>
      so the <m>y</m>-intercept
      is <m>\left( 0, -\frac{9}{5} \right)</m>.

        <introduction>
          <p>
  		Because any rational function is the ratio of two polynomial functions, it's natural to ask questions about rational functions similar to those we ask about polynomials.  With polynomials, it is often helpful to know where the function's value is zero.  In a rational function <m>r(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m>, we are curious to know where both <m>p(x) = 0</m> and where <m>q(x) = 0</m>.  
  	</p>
          <p>
  		Connected to these questions, we want to understand both where a rational function's output value is zero, as well as where the function is undefined.  In addition, from the behavior of simple rational power functions such as <m>\frac{1}{x}</m>, we expect that rational functions may not only have horizontal asymptotes (as investigated in <xref ref="sec-poly-rational">Section</xref>), but also vertical asymptotes.  At first glance, these questions about zeros and vertical asymptotes of rational functions may appear to be elementary ones whose answers simply depend on where the numerator and denominator of the rational function are zero.  But in fact, rational functions often admit very subtle behavior that can escape the human eye and the graph generated by a computer.

        <subsection xml:id="subsec-poly-rational-features-hole">
          <title>When a rational function has a <q>hole</q></title>
          <p>
  		Two important features of any rational function <m>r(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m> are any zeros and vertical asymptotes the function may have.  These aspects of a rational function are closely connected to where the numerator and denominator, respectively, are zero.  At the same time, a subtle related issue can lead to radically different behavior.  To understand why, we first remind ourselves of a few key facts about fractions that involve <m>0</m>.  Because we are working with a function, we'll think about fractions whose numerator and denominator are approaching particular values.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		If the numerator of a fraction approaches <m>0</m> while the denominator approaches a nonzero value, then the overall fraction values will approach zero.  For instance, consider the sequence of values
  		<me>
  			\frac{0.1}{0.9} = 0.111111\cdots, \frac{0.01}{0.99} = 0.010101\cdots, \frac{0.001}{0.999} = 0.001001\cdots
  		</me>.
  		Because the numerator gets closer and closer to <m>0</m> and the denominator stays away from <m>0</m>, the quotients tend to <m>0</m>.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		Similarly, if the denominator of a fraction approaches <m>0</m> while the numerator approaches a nonzero value, then the overall fraction increases without bound.  If we consider the reciprocal values of the sequence above, we see that
  		<me>
  			\frac{0.9}{0.1} = 9, \frac{0.99}{0.01} = 99, \frac{0.999}{0.001} = 999
  		</me>.
  		Since the denominator gets closer and closer to <m>0</m> and the numerator stays away from <m>0</m>, the quotients increase without bound.
  	</p>
          <p>
  		These two behaviors show how the zeros and vertical asympototes of a rational function <m>r(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m> arise:  where the numerator <m>p(x)</m> is zero and the denominator <m>q(x)</m> is nonzero, the function <m>r</m> will have a zero; and where <m>q(x)</m> is zero and <m>p(x)</m> is nonzero, the function will have a vertical asymptote.  What we must be careful of is the special situation where <em>both</em> the numerator <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> are simultaneously zero.  Indeed, if the numerator and denominator of a fraction both approach <m>0</m>, different behavior can arise.  For instance, consider the sequence
  		<me>
  			\frac{0.2}{0.1} = 2, \frac{0.02}{0.01} = 2, \frac{0.002}{0.001} = 2
  		</me>.  
  		In this situation, both the numerator and denominator are approaching <m>0</m>, but the overall fraction's value is always <m>2</m>.  This is very different from the two sequences we considered above.  In <xref ref="ex-rational-features-hole">Example</xref>, we explore similar behavior in the context of a particular rational function.
  	</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-rational-features-hole">
            <statement>
              <p>
  				Consider the rational function <m>r(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2 - 3x - 4}</m> from <xref ref="PA-poly-rational-features">Preview Activity</xref>, whose numerator is <m>p(x) = x^2 - 1</m> and whose denominator is <m>q(x) = x^2 - 3x - 4</m>.  Explain why the graph of <m>r</m> generated by <em>Desmos</em> or another computational device is incorrect, and also identify the locations of any zeros and vertical asymptotes of <m>r</m>.
  			</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
  				It is helpful with any rational function to factor the numerator and denominator.  We note that <m>p(x) = x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)</m> and <m>q(x) = x^2 - 3x - 4 = (x+1)(x-4)</m>.  The domain of <m>r</m> is thus the set of all real numbers except <m>x = -1</m> and <m>x = 4</m>, the set of all points where <m>q(x) \ne 0</m>.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				Knowing that <m>r</m> is not defined at <m>x = -1</m>, it is natural to study the graph of <m>r</m> near that value.  Plotting the function in <em>Desmos</em>, we get a result similar to the one shown in <xref ref="F-rational-features-hole-1A">Figure</xref>, which appears to show no unusual behavior at <m>x = -1</m>, and even that <m>r(-1)</m> is defined.  If we zoom in on that point, as shown in <xref ref="F-rational-features-hole-1A-zoom">Figure</xref>, the technology still fails to visually demonstrate the fact that <m>r(-1)</m> is not defined.  This is because graphing utilities sample functions at a finite number of points and then connect the resulting dots to generate the curve we see.

              <p>
  				In the table, we see that both the numerator and denominator get closer and closer to <m>0</m> as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer to <m>-1</m>, but that their quotient appears to be getting closer and closer to <m>y = 0.4</m>.  Indeed, we see this behavior in the graph of <m>r</m>, though the graphing utility misses the fact that <m>r(-1)</m> is actually not defined.  A precise graph of <m>r</m> near <m>x = -1</m> should look like the one presented in <xref ref="F-rational-features-hole-1A-zoom-actual">Figure</xref>, where we see an open circle at the point <m>(-1, 0.4)</m> that demonstrates that <m>r(-1)</m> is not defined, and that <m>r</m> does not have a vertical asymptote or zero at <m>x = -1</m>.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				Finally, we also note that <m>p(1) = 0</m> and <m>q(1) = -6</m>, so at <m>x = 1</m>, <m>r(x)</m> has a zero (its numerator is zero and its denominator is not).  In addition, <m>q(4) = 0</m> and <m>p(4) = 15</m> (its denominator is zero and its numerator is not), so <m>r(x)</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x = 4</m>.  These features are accurately represented by the original <em>Desmos</em> graph shown in <xref ref="F-rational-features-hole-1A">Figure</xref>.

		In the situation where a rational function is undefined at a point but does not have a vertical asymptote there, we'll say that the graph of the function has a <term>hole</term>.  <idx><h>rational function</h><h>hole</h></idx> In calculus, we use limit notation to identify a hole in a function's graph.  Indeed, having shown in <xref ref="ex-rational-features-hole">Example</xref> that the value of <m>r(x)</m> gets closer and closer to <m>0.4</m> as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer to <m>-1</m>, we naturally write
		<me>

		</me>
		as a shorthand way to represent the behavior of <m>r</m> (similar to how we've written limits involving <m>\infty</m>). This fact, combined with <m>r(-1)</m> being undefined, tells us that near <m>x = -1</m> the graph approaches a value of <m>0.4</m> but has to have a hole at the point <m>(-1,0.4)</m>, as shown in <xref ref="F-rational-features-hole-1A-zoom-actual">Figure</xref>.  Because we'll encounter similar behavior with other functions, we formally define limit notation as follows.

          <title>Sign charts and finding formulas for rational functions</title>
          <p>
  		Just like with polynomial functions, we can use sign charts to describe the behavior of rational functions.  The only significant difference for their use in this context is that we not only must include all <m>x</m>-values where the rational function <m>r(x) = 0</m>, but also all <m>x</m>-values at which the function <m>r</m> is not defined.  This is because it is possible for a rational function to change sign at a point that lies outside its domain, such as when the function has a vertical asymptote.
  	</p>
          <example xml:id="ex-rational-sign-chart">
            <statement>
              <p>
  				Construct a sign chart for the function <m>q(x) = \frac{(x-2)(x^2-9)}{(x-3)(x-1)^2}</m>.  Then, graph the function <m>q</m> and compare the graph and sign chart.
  			</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
  				First, we fully factor <m>q</m> and identify the <m>x</m>-values that are not in its domain.  Since <m>x^2-9 = (x-3)(x+3)</m>, we see that
  				<me>
  					q(x) = \frac{(x-2)(x-3)(x+3)}{(x-3)(x-1)^2}
  				</me>.
  				From the denominator, we observe that <m>q</m> is not defined at <m>x = 3</m> and <m>x = 1</m> since those values make the factors <m>x - 3 = 0</m> or <m>(x-1)^2 = 0</m>.  Thus, the domain of <m>q</m> is the set of all real numbers except <m>x = 1</m> and <m>x = 3</m>.  From the numerator, we see that both <m>x = 2</m> and <m>x = -3</m> are zeros of <m>q</m> since these values make the numerator zero while the denominator is nonzero.  We expect that <m>q</m> will have a hole at <m>x = 3</m> since this <m>x</m>-value is not in the domain and it makes both the numerator and denominator <m>0</m>.  Indeed, computing values of <m>q</m> for <m>x</m> near <m>x = 3</m> suggests that
  				<me>
  					\lim_{x \to 3} q(x) = 1.5
  				</me>,
  				and thus <m>q</m> does not change sign at <m>x = 3</m>.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				Thus, we have three different <m>x</m>-values to place on the sign chart:  <m>x = -3</m>, <m>x = 1</m>, and <m>x = 2</m>.  We now analyze the sign of each of the factors in <m>q(x) = \frac{(x-2)(x-3)(x+3)}{(x-3)(x-1)^2}</m> on the various intervals.  For <m>x \lt -3</m>, <m>(x-2) \lt 0</m>, <m>(x-3) \lt 0</m>, <m>(x+3) \lt 0</m>, and <m>(x-1)^2 \gt 0</m>.  Thus, for <m>x \lt -3</m>, the sign of <m>q</m> is
  				<me>
  					\frac{- - -}{- +} = +
  				</me>
  				since there are an even number of negative terms in the quotient.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				On the interval <m>-3 \lt x \lt 1</m>, <m>(x-2) \lt 0</m>, <m>(x-3) \lt 0</m>, <m>(x+3) \gt 0</m>, and <m>(x-1)^2 \gt 0</m>.  Thus, for these <m>x</m>-values, the sign of <m>q</m> is 
  				<me>
  					\frac{- - +}{- +} = -
  				</me>.
  			</p>
              <p>
  				Using similar reasoning, we can complete the sign chart shown in <xref ref="F-ex-rational-sign-chart">Figure</xref>.  A plot of the function <m>q</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-ex-rational-plot">Figure</xref>, shows behavior that matches the sign function, as well as the need to manually identify the hole at <m>(3, 1.5)</m>, which is missed by the graphing software.
  			</p>
              <sidebyside widths="55% 40%" valign="middle" margins="0%">
                <figure xml:id="F-ex-rational-sign-chart">
                  <caption>The sign chart for <m>q</m>.</caption>
                  <image source="images/rational-sign-chart"/>
                </figure>
                <figure xml:id="F-ex-rational-plot">

                </figure>
              </sidebyside>
              <p>
  				In both the sign chart and the figure, we see that <m>q</m> changes sign at each of its zeros, <m>x = -3</m> and <m>x = 2</m>, and that it does not change as it passes by its vertical asymptote at <m>x = 1</m>.  The reason <m>q</m> doesn't change sign at the asympotote is because of the repeated factor of <m>(x-1)^2</m> which is always positive.
  			</p>
            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
  		To find a formula for a rational function with certain properties, we can reason in ways that are similar to our work with polynomials.  Since the rational function must have a polynomial expression in both the numerator and denominator, by thinking about where the numerator and denominator must be zero, we can often generate a formula whose graph will satisfy the desired properties.

      (a) The graph shows <m>y= 1/x</m> shifted to
      the left 1 and up 2 units. Thus,
      <me>y = \frac{1}{x + 1}+2</me>
      is a choice for a formula.
      
      
      
      
      (b) The equation
      <me>y = \frac{1}{x + 1}+2 = \frac{ 2 x + 3}{x+1}.</me>
      
      
      
      
      (c) We see that the graph has both an <m>x</m>-and
      <m>y</m>-intercept.
      If <m>y=0</m> then <m>2 x+3=0</m>, so <m>x= -\frac{3}{2}</m>.
      The <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>\left( -\frac{3}{2}, 0 \right)</m>.
      
      
      
      When <m>x=0</m>,
      <me>y= f(0) = \frac{ 2 (0) + 3}{0+1} = \frac{3}{1},</me>
      so the <m>y</m>-intercept
      is <m>\left( 0, 3 \right)</m>.

      Start with our property of inverse functions

      <m>f^{-1}(x)</m> to get <m>f(y)=x</m>. Now, using the formula for
      <m>f</m> we get <m>\displaystyle f(y) = \frac{6 y - 6}{7 y + 4} =x</m>

      <me>\begin{aligned}
      \frac{6 y - 6}{7 y + 4} \amp =x \\
      6 y -6 \amp = x(7 y+4) \\

      6 y- 7 yx \amp = 4 x +6 \\
      y(6- 7 x) \amp = 4 x +6 \\
      y \amp = \frac{4 x + 6}{6 - 7 x}.

      Now replacing <m>y</m> by <m>f^{-1}(x)</m>, we have our formula,

      (a) A graph of <m>f</m> for <m>0 \leq t \leq 20</m> and <m>0 \leq y \leq 1.1</m> is shown in the figure below:
      
      
      
      
      <sidebyside widths="50%"><image source="images/webwork-152-image-1.png"/></sidebyside>
      
      
      
      
      At <m>t=0</m> the oxygen is at its normal level in the pond. The level
      decreases sharply for the first week after the waste is dumped into
      the pond. The oxygen level reaches its minimum of approximately
      one half the normal level by the end of the first week. Then the
      level begins to increase.
      
      
      
      (b) Eventually, the oxygen level in the pond will once again approach the
      normal level of one.  This is visualized by the gray horizontal asymptote <m>y = 1</m> in the graph above.
      
      
      
      (c) The line <m>y= 0.8</m> is shown in figure above. After the level
      has reached its minimum, we can approximate the intersection of <m>f</m>
      and <m>y= 0.8</m> at <m>t \approx 4.791</m>. Thus, it takes about <m>4.791</m> weeks for the level to return to <m>80</m>% normal.

        For each of the following rational functions, identify the location of any potential hole in the graph.  Then, create a table of function values for input values near where the hole should be located.  Use your work to decide whether or not the graph indeed has a hole, with written justification.
