	<introduction>
		<p>
    		Given a function that models a certain phenomenon,
    		it's natural to ask such questions as
  			<q>how is the function changing on a given interval</q> or
    		<q>on which interval is the function changing more rapidly?</q>
    		The concept of <em>average rate of change</em>
    		enables us to make these questions more mathematically precise.
    		Initially, we will focus on the average rate of change of an object moving along a straight-line path.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			For a function <m>s</m> that tells the location of a moving object along a straight path at time <m>t</m>, we define the average rate of change of <m>s</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> to be the quantity 
  			<me>
  				AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}
  			</me>.
  			<idx><h>average rate of change</h><h>of position</h></idx>
  			Note particularly that the average rate of change of <m>s</m> on <m>[a,b]</m> is measuring the
    		<em>change in position</em> divided by the <em>change in time</em>.

		<title>Defining and interpreting the average rate of change of a function</title>
		<p>
			In the context of a function that measures height or position of a moving object at a given time,
    		the meaning of the average rate of change of the function on a given interval is the <em>average velocity</em> <idx><h>average velocity</h></idx> of the moving object
    		because it is the ratio of <em>change in position</em> to <em>change in time</em>.  For example, in <xref ref="PA-changing-aroc">Preview Activity</xref>, the units on <m>AV_{[1.5,2.5]} = -32</m> are <q>feet per second</q> since the units on the numerator are <q>feet</q> and on the denominator <q>seconds</q>.  Morever, <m>-32</m> is numerically the same value as the slope of the line that connects the two corresponding points on the graph of the position function, as seen in <xref ref="F-aroc-s-t-ex-1">Figure</xref>.  The fact that the average rate of change is negative in this example indicates that the ball is falling.

		</sidebyside>

		<p>
		    While the average rate of change of a position function tells us the moving object's average velocity, in other contexts,
		    the average rate of change of a function can be similarly defined and has a related interpretation.  We make the following formal definition.
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="D-aroc-aroc">
			<idx><h>average rate of change</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					For a function <m>f</m> defined on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>, the <term>average rate of change of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m></term> is the quantity 
					<me>
						AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}
					</me>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
		    In every situation, the units on the average rate of change help us interpret its meaning,
		    and those units are always <q>units of output per unit of input.</q> <idx><h>average rate of change</h><h>units</h></idx>  Moreover, the average rate of change of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m> always corresponds to the slope of the line between the points <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m>, as seen in <xref ref="F-aroc-f-x-defn">Figure</xref>.
		</p>

		<xi:include href="./activities/act-changing-aroc-population.xml" />

		<p>
			The average rate of change of a function on an interval gives us an excellent way to describe how the function behaves, on average.  For instance, if we compute <m>AV_{[1970,2000]}</m> for Kent County, we find that 
			<me>
				AV_{[1970,2000]} = \frac{573,336 - 411,044}{30} = 5409.73
			</me>,
			which tells us that in an average year from 1970 to 2000, the population of Kent County increased by about <m>5410</m> people.  Said differently, we could also say that from 1970 to 2000, Kent County was growing at an average rate of <m>5410</m> people per year.  These ideas also afford the opportunity to make comparisons over time.  Since
			<me>
				AV_{[1990,2000]} = \frac{573,336 - 500,631}{30} = 7270.5
			</me>,
			we can not only say that the county's population increased by about <m>7270</m> in an average year between 1990 and 2000, but also that the population was growing faster from 1990 to 2000 than it did from 1970 to 2000.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, we can even use the average rate of change of a function to predict future behavior.  Since the population was changing on average by <m>7270.5</m> people per year from 1990 to 2000, we can estimate that the population in 2002 is 
			<me>
				K(2002) \approx K(2000) + 2 \cdot 7270.5 = 573,336 + 14,541 = 587,877
			</me>.
		</p>

		<title>How average rate of change indicates function trends</title>

		<p>
			We have already seen that it is natural to use words such as <q>increasing</q> and <q>decreasing</q> to describe a function's behavior.  For instance, for the tennis ball whose height is modeled by <m>s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2</m>, we computed that <m>AV_{[1.5,2.5]} = -32</m>, which indicates that on the interval <m>[1.5,2.5]</m>, the tennis ball's height is decreasing at an average rate of <m>32</m> feet per second.  Similarly, for the population of Kent County, since <m>AV_{[1990,2000]} = 7270.5</m>, we know that on the interval <m>[1990,2000]</m> the population is increasing at an average rate of <m>7270.5</m> people per year.
		</p>

		<p>
			We make the following formal definitions to clarify what it means to say that a function is increasing or decreasing.
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="D-aroc-increasing-decreasing">
			<idx><h>function trends</h><h>increasing</h></idx> <idx><h>function trends</h><h>decreasing</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Let <m>f</m> be a function defined on an interval <m>(a,b)</m> (that is, on the set of all <m>x</m> for which <m>a \lt x \lt b</m>).  We say that <m>f</m> is <term>increasing on <m>(a,b)</m></term> provided that the function is always rising as we move from left to right.  That is, for any <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>(a,b)</m>, if <m>x \lt y</m>, then <m>f(x) \lt f(y)</m>.  
				</p>

				<p>
					Similarly, we say that <m>f</m> is <term>decreasing on <m>(a,b)</m></term> provided that 
           			the function is always falling as we move from left to right.  That is, for any <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>(a,b)</m>,  if <m>x \lt y</m>, then <m>f(x) \gt f(y)</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			If we compute the average rate of change of a function on an interval, we can decide if the function is increasing or decreasing <em>on average</em> on the interval, but it takes more work<fn>Calculus offers one way to justify that a function is always increasing or always decreasing on an interval.</fn> to decide if the function is increasing or decreasing <em>always</em> on the interval.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is helpful be able to connect information about a function's average rate of change and its graph.  For instance, if we have determined that <m>AV_{[-3,2]} = 1.75</m> for some function <m>f</m>, this tells us that, on average, the function rises between the points <m>x = -3</m> and <m>x = 2</m> and does so at an average rate of <m>1.75</m> vertical units for every horizontal unit.  Moreover, we can even determine that the difference between <m>f(2)</m> and <m>f(-3)</m> is
			<me>
				f(2)-f(-3) = 1.75 \cdot 5 = 8.75
			</me>
			since <m>\frac{f(2)-f(-3)}{2-(-3)} = 1.75</m>.
