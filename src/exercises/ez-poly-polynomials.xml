              Even in an adjusted window, can you tell them exactly from the graph?

        Like we have worked to understand families of functions that involve parameters such as
        <m>p(t) = a\cos(k(t-b)) + c</m> and <m>F(t) = a + be^{-kt}</m>,
        we are often interested in polynomials that involve one or more parameters and understanding how those parameters affect the function's behavior.

        For example, let <m>a \gt 0</m> be a positive constant,
        and consider <m>p(x) = x^3 - a^2x</m>.
