  <exercise xml:id="ez-trig-right-lamppost">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A person standing <m>50</m> feet away from a streetlight observes that they cast a shadow that is <m>14</m> feet long.  If a ray of light from the streetlight to the tip of the person's shadow forms an angle of <m>27.5^\circ</m> with the ground, how tall is the person and how tall is the streetlight?  What other information about the situation can you determine?

  <exercise xml:id="ez-trig-right-rocket">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A person watching a rocket launch uses a laser range-finder to measure the distance from themselves to the rocket.  The range-finder also reports the angle at which the finder is being elevated from horizontal.  At a certain instant, the range-finder reports that it is elevated at an angle of <m>17.4^\circ</m> from horizontal and that the distance to the rocket is <m>1650</m> meters.  How high off the ground is the rocket?  Assuming a straight-line vertical path for the rocket that is perpendicular to the earth, how far away was the rocket from the range-finder at the moment it was launched?

  <exercise xml:id="ez-trig-right-trough">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A trough is constructed by bending a <m>4' \times 24'</m> rectangular sheet of metal.  Two symmetric folds <m>2</m> feet apart are made parallel to the longest side of the rectangle so that the trough has cross-sections in the shape of a trapezoid, as pictured in <xref ref="F-right-triangle-trough">Figure</xref>.  Determine a formula for <m>V(\theta)</m>, the volume of the trough as a function of <m>\theta</m>.  (Hint:  the volume of the trough is the area of a cross-section times the length of the trough.)
