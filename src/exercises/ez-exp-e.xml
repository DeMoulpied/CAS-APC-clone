  <exercise xml:id="ez-exp-e-continously-compounded">
    <statement>
      <p>
        When a single investment of principal, $<m>P</m>, is invested in an account that returns interest at an annual rate of <m>r</m> (a decimal that corresponds to the percentage rate, such as <m>r = 0.05</m> corresponding to <m>5</m>%) that is compounded <m>n</m> times per year, the amount of money in the account after <m>t</m> years is given by <m>A(t) = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose we invest $<m>P</m> in an account that earns <m>8</m> <percent></percent> annual interest.  We investigate the effects of different rates of compounding.  
      </p>

      <p>
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Compute <m>A(1)</m> if interest is compounded quarterly (<m>n = 4</m>).

          <li>
            <p>
              Compute <m>A(1)</m> if interest is compounded monthly.

          <li>
            <p>
              If we let the number of times that interest is compounded increase without bound, we say that the interest is <q>compounded continuously</q>.  <idx><h>continuously compounded interest</h></idx>  When interest is compounded continuously, it turns out that the amount of money an account with initial investment $<m>P</m> after <m>t</m> years at an annual interest rate of <m>r</m> is <m>A(t) = Pe^{rt}</m>, where <m>e</m> is the natural base.  Compute <m>A(1)</m> in the same context as the preceding questions but where interest is compounded continuously.

              How much of a difference does continuously compounded interest make over interest compounded quarterly in one year's time?  How does your answer change over <m>25</m> years' time?
