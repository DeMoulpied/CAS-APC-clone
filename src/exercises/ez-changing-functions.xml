    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider an inverted conical tank (point down) whose top has a radius of <m>3</m> feet and that is <m>2</m> feet deep.  The tank is initially empty and then is filled at a constant rate of <m>0.75</m> cubic feet per minute.  Let <m>V=f(t)</m> denote the volume of water (in cubic feet) at time <m>t</m> in minutes, and let <m>h= g(t)</m> denote the depth of the water (in feet) at time <m>t</m>.
      </p>

        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Recall that the volume of a conical tank of radius <m>r</m> and depth <m>h</m> is given by the formula <m>V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h</m>.  How long will it take for the tank to be completely full and how much water will be in the tank at that time?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              On the provided axes, sketch possible graphs of both <m>V = f(t)</m> and <m>h = g(t)</m>, making them as accurate as you can.  Label the scale on your axes and points whose coordinates you know for sure; write at least one sentence for each graph to discuss the shape of your graph and why it makes sense in the context of the model.

              It's possible to show that the formula for the function <m>g</m> is <m>g(t) = \left( \frac{t}{\pi} \right)^{1/3}</m>.  Use a computational device to generate two plots:  on the axes at left, the graph of the model <m>h = g(t) = \left( \frac{t}{\pi} \right)^{1/3}</m> on the domain that you decided in (c); on the axes at right, the graph of the abstract function <m>y = p(x) = \left( \frac{t}{\pi} \right)^{1/3}</m> on a wider domain than that of <m>g</m>.  What are the domain and range of <m>p</m> and how do these differ from those of the physical model <m>g</m>?

  <exercise xml:id="ez-functions-gas-distance">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A driver of a new car periodically keeps track of the number of gallons of gas remaining in their car's tank, while simultaneously tracking the trip odometer mileage.  Their data is recorded in the following table.  Note that at mileages where they add fuel to the tank, they record the mileage twice:  once before fuel is added, and once afterward.
