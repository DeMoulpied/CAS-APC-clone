  <exercise xml:id="ez-poly-infty-comparisons">
    <statement>
      <p>
        We've observed that several different familiar functions grow without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>, including <m>f(x) = \ln(x)</m>, <m>g(x) = x^2</m>, and <m>h(x) = e^x</m>.  In this exercise, we compare and contrast how these three functions grow.

  <exercise xml:id="ez-poly-infty-frac-powers">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Power functions can have powers that are not whole numbers.  For instance, we can consider such functions as 
        <m>f(x)=x^{2.4}</m>, <m>g(x)=x^{2.5}</m>, and <m>h(x)=x^{2.6}</m>. 
      </p>

        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Compare and contrast the graphs of <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>, and <m>h</m>.  How are they similar?  How are they different?  (There is a lot you can discuss here.) 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Observe that we can think of <m>f(x) = x^{2.4}</m> as <m>f(x) = x^{24/10} = x^{12/5}</m>.  In addition, recall by exponent rules that we can also view <m>f</m> as having the form <m>f(x) = \sqrt[5]{x^{12}}</m>.  Write <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> in similar forms, and explain why <m>g</m> has a different domain than <m>f</m> and <m>h</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              How do the graphs of <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>, and <m>h</m> compare to the graphs of <m>y = x^2</m> and <m>y = x^3</m>?  Why are these natural functions to use for comparison?
