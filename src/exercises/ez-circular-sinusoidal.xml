<exercise xml:id="ez-circular-sinusoidal-daylight">
    <statement>
      <p>
        In 2018, on the summer solstice, June 21, Grand Rapids, MI, experiences <m>15</m> hours, <m>21</m> minutes, and <m>25</m> seconds of daylight.  Said differently, on the <m>172</m>nd day of the year, people on earth at the latitude of Grand Rapids experience <m>15.3569</m> hours of daylight.  On the winter solstice, December 21, 2018, the same latitude has <m>9</m> hours, <m>0</m> minutes, and <m>31</m> seconds of daylight; equivalently, on  day <m>355</m>, there are <m>9.0086</m> hours of daylight.  This data is essentially identical every year as the patterns of the earth's rotation repeat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let <m>t</m> be the day of the year starting with <m>t = 0</m> on December 31, 2017.  In addition, let <m>s(t)</m> be the number of hours of daylight on day <m>t</m> in Grand Rapids, MI.  Find a formula for a circular function <m>s(t)</m> that fits this data.  What is the function's midline, amplitude, and period?  What are you using as an anchor point?  Explain fully, and then graph your function to check your conclusions.
