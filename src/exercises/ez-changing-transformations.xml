  <exercise xml:id="ez-changing-transformations-horiz-scaling">
    <statement>
      <p>
        We have explored the effects of adding a constant to the output of a function, <m>y = f(x) + a</m>, adding a constant to the input, <m>y = f(x+a)</m>, and multiplying the output of a function by a constant, <m>y = af(x)</m>.  There is one remaining natural transformation to explore:  multiplying the input to a function by a constant.  In this exercise, we consider the effects of the constant <m>a</m> in transforming a parent function <m>f</m> by the rule <m>y = f(ax)</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let <m>f(x) = (x-2)^2 + 1</m>.

      <p>
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>g(x) = f(4x)</m>, <m>h(x) = f(2x)</m>, <m>k(x) = f(0.5x)</m>, and <m>m(x) = f(0.25x)</m>.  Use <em>Desmos</em> to plot these functions.  Then, sketch and label <m>g</m>, <m>h</m>, <m>k</m>, and <m>m</m> on the provided axes in <xref ref="F-ez-transformations-blank-axes">Figure</xref> along with the graph of <m>f</m>.  For each of the functions, label and identify its vertex, its <m>y</m>-intercept, and its <m>x</m>-intercepts.

              Based on your work in (a), how would you describe the effect(s) of the transformation <m>y = f(ax)</m> where <m>a \gt 0</m>?  What is the impact on the graph of <m>f</m>?  Are any parts of the graph of <m>f</m> unchanged?

              Now consider the function <m>r(x) = f(-x)</m>.  Observe that <m>r(-1) = f(1)</m>, <m>r(2) = f(-2)</m>, and so on.  Without using a graphing utility, how do you expect the graph of <m>y = r(x)</m> to compare to the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>?  Explain.  Then test your conjecture by using a graphing utility and record the plots of <m>f</m> and <m>r</m> on the axes in <xref ref="F-ez-transformations-blank-axes-2">Figure</xref>.

              How do you expect the graph of <m>s(x) = f(-2x)</m> to appear?  Why?  More generally, how does the graph of <m>y = f(ax)</m> compare to the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> in the situation where <m>a \lt 0</m>?
