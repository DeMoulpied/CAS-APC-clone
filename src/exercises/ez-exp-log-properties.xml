    <statement>
      <p>
        A new car is purchased for $<m>28000</m>.  Exactly <m>1</m> year later, the value of the car is $<m>23200</m>.  Assume that the car's value in dollars, <m>V</m>, <m>t</m> years after purchase decays exponentially according to a model of form <m>V(t) = Ae^{-kt}</m>.

  <exercise xml:id="ez-exp-log-properties-Golden-Rule">
    <statement>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="ez-exp-log-base-b">Exercise</xref>, we explored graphically how the function <m>y = \log_b(x)</m> can be thought of as a vertical stretch of the nautral logarithm, <m>y = \ln(x)</m>.  In this exercise, we determine the exact value of the vertical stretch that is needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recall that <m>\log_b(x)</m> is the power to which we raise <m>b</m> to get <m>x</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Write the equation <m>y = \log_b(x)</m> as an equivalent equation involving exponents with no logarithms present.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Take the equation you found in (a) and take the natural logarithm of each side.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use rules and properties of logarithms appropriately to solve the equation from (b) for <m>y</m>.  Your result here should express <m>y</m> in terms of <m>\ln(x)</m> and <m>\ln(b)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Recall that <m>y = \log_b(x)</m>.  Explain why the following equation (often called the Golden Rule for Logarithms) is true:
              <me>
                \log_b(y) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)}
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              What is the value of <m>k</m> that allows us to express the function <m>y = \log_b(x)</m> as a vertical stretch of the function <m>y = \ln(x)</m>?
