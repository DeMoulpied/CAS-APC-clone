        Recall Dolbear's function that defines temperature,

        is <m>F = D(N) = 40 + \frac{1}{4}N</m>.

  <exercise xml:id="ez-composite-spherical-tank">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A spherical tank has radius <m>4</m> feet.  The tank is initially empty and then begins to be filled in such a way that the height of the water rises at a constant rate of <m>0.4</m> feet per minute.  Let <m>V</m> be the volume of water in the tank at a given instant, and <m>h</m> the depth of the water at the same instant; let <m>t</m> denote the time elapsed in minutes since the tank started being filled.

            <p>
              Calculus can be used to show that the volume, <m>V</m>, is a function of the depth, <m>h</m>, of the water in the tank according to the function 
              <men xml:id="E-ez-composite-spherical-tank-V-h">
                V = f(h) = \frac{\pi}{3} h^2(12-h)

              What is the domain of this model?  Why?  What is the corresponding range?

              We are given the fact that the tank is being filled in such a way that the height of the water rises at a constant rate of <m>0.4</m> feet per minute.  Said differently, <m>h</m> is a function of <m>t</m> whose average rate of change is constant.  What kind of function does this make <m>h = p(t)</m>?  Determine a formula for <m>p(t)</m>.

              What are the domain and range of the function <m>h = p(t)</m>?  How is this tied to the dimensions of the tank?

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In (a) we observed that <m>V</m> is a function of <m>h</m>, and in (b) we found that <m>h</m> is a function of <m>t</m>.  Use these two facts and function composition appropriately to write <m>V</m> as a function of <m>t</m>.  Call the resulting function <m>V = q(t)</m>.

            <p>
              On the provided axes, sketch accurate graphs of <m>h = p(t)</m> and <m>V = q(t)</m>, labeling the vertical and horizontal scale on each graph appropriately.  Make your graphs as precise as you can; use a computing device to assist as needed.
