    <statement>
      <p>
        A can of soda has been in a refrigerator for several days; the refrigerator has temperature <m>41^\circ</m> Fahrenheit.  Upon removal, the soda is placed on a kitchen table in a room with surrounding temperature <m>72^\circ</m>.  Let <m>F(t)</m> represent the soda's temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at time <m>t</m> in minutes, where <m>t = 0</m> corresponds to the time the can is removed from the refrigerator.  We know from Newton's Law of Cooling that <m>F</m> has form <m>F(t) = ab^t + c</m> for some constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>, where <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>.

  <exercise xml:id="ez-exp-modeling-coffee">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A cup of coffee has its temperature, <m>C(t)</m>, measured in degrees Celsius.  When poured outdoors on a cold morning, its temperature is <m>C(0) = 95</m>.  Ten minutes later, <m>C(10) = 80</m>.  If the surrounding temperature outside is <m>0^\circ</m> Celsius, find a formula for a function <m>C(t)</m> that models the coffee's temperature at time <m>t</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, recall that we can convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit according to the equations <m>F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32</m> and <m>C = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)</m>.  Use this information to also find a formula for <m>F(t)</m>, the coffee's Fahrenheit temperature at time <m>t</m>.  What is similar and what is different regarding the functions <m>C(t)</m> and <m>F(t)</m>?
