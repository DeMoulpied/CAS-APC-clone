  <exercise xml:id="ez-changing-aroc-position-graph">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The position of a car driving along a straight road at time <m>t</m> in minutes is given by the function
        <m>y = s(t)</m> that is pictured in <xref ref="F-aroc-ez-position-graph">Figure</xref>.
        The car's position function has units measured in thousands of feet.
        For instance,
        the point <m>(2,4)</m> on the graph indicates that after 2 minutes,
        the car has traveled 4000 feet.

  <exercise xml:id="ez-changing-aroc-3">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider an inverted conical tank (point down) whose top has a radius of <m>3</m> feet and that is <m>2</m> feet deep.  The tank is initially empty and then is filled at a constant rate of <m>0.75</m> cubic feet per minute.  Let <m>V=f(t)</m> denote the volume of water (in cubic feet) at time <m>t</m> in minutes, and let <m>h= g(t)</m> denote the depth of the water (in feet) at time <m>t</m>.  It turns out that the formula for the function <m>g</m> is <m>g(t) = \left( \frac{t}{\pi} \right)^{1/3}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <ol label="a.">
          <li>
            <p>
              In everyday language, describe how you expect the height function <m>h = g(t)</m> to behave as time increases.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For the height function <m>h = g(t) = \left( \frac{t}{\pi} \right)^{1/3}</m>, compute <m>AV_{[0,2]}</m>, <m>AV_{[2,4]}</m>, and <m>AV_{[4,6]}</m>.  Include units on your results.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Again working with the height function, can you determine an interval <m>[a,b]</m> on which <m>AV_{[a,b]} = 2</m> feet per minute?  If yes, state the interval; if not, explain why there is no such interval.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now consider the volume function, <m>V = f(t)</m>.  Even though we don't have a formula for <m>f</m>, is it possible to determine the average rate of change of the volume function on the intervals <m>[0,2]</m>, <m>[2,4]</m>, and <m>[4,6]</m>?  Why or why not?
