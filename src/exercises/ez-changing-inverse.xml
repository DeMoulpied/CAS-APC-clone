    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider an inverted conical tank that is being filled with water.  The tank's radius is <m>2</m> m and its depth is <m>4</m> m.  Suppose the tank is initially empty and is being filled in such a way that the height of the water is always rising at a rate of <m>0.25</m> meters per minute.

          <li>
            <p>
              Explain why the height, <m>h</m>, of the water can be viewed as a function of <m>t</m> according to the formula <m>h= f(t) = 0.25t</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose we think of the volume, <m>V</m>, of water in the tank as a function of <m>t</m> and name the function <m>V = g(t)</m>.  Do you expect that the function <m>g</m> has an inverse function?  Why or why not?

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Recall that the volume of a cone of radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m> is <m>V = \frac{\pi}{3} r^2 h</m>.  Due to the shape of the tank, similar triangles tell us that <m>r</m> and <m>h</m> satisfy the proportion <m>r = \frac{1}{2}h</m>, and thus 
              <men xml:id="E-ez-changing-inverse-V-h">
                V = \frac{\pi}{3} \left( \frac{1}{2}h \right)^2 h = \frac{\pi}{12}h^3

            </p>

            <p>
              Use the fact that <m>h = f(t) = 0.25t</m> along with <xref ref="E-ez-changing-inverse-V-h">Equation</xref> to find a formula for <m>V = g(t)</m>.  Sketch a plot of <m>V = g(t)</m> on the blank axes provided in <xref ref="F-inverse-ez-blank-axes-V-t">Figure</xref>.  Write at least one sentence to explain why <m>V = g(t)</m> has the shape that it does.

          <li>
            <p>
              Take the formula for <m>V = g(t)</m> that you determined in (d) and solve for <m>t</m> to determine a formula for <m>t = g^{-1}(V)</m>.  What is the meaning of the formula you find?
